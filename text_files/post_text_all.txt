I'm not sure if I posted these before, but I figure I'll share a few experiences. You may use my stories in podcasts and such, just please credit my username. :)  &#x200B;  The majority of my paranormal experiences were in my childhood home, although a few notable ones happened outside of my home, though in the same area. For context, I believe my childhood home (which I have moved out of as an adult now) was haunted due to the environment / circumstance. There is a creek running through the neighborhood, and lots of telephone poles, so the energy currents are strong there. Some people believe that ghosts can manifest easier when in areas of high energy currents.  &#x200B;  A few anecdotes from my childhood home:  \- When I was about 4 years old, I recall playing with my brother in the hallway of my home. I was a long hall that lead to the bathrooms and bedrooms. We were playing something akin to tag but with an element of hide n seek. So, we run up and down the hall a few times, and on the last time I was running up to his room, which was the last door of that hallway, he laughs and closes the door behind him. I suddenly stopped, and thought I hit the door and bounced back. I looked up and saw a giant toad. I thought that was odd, and didn't register it as anything malevolent. Maybe it protected me from the door impact? As odd as it is that most people don't seem to interact with nature spirits, this time I did. And what's more is that much later in life I asked my brother if he remembered the giant toad spirit that day, and he said he did. He also didn't like talking about it, so didn't clarify. But, it's my first memorable paranormal experience.  &#x200B;  \- My paranormal experiences ramped up as a teenager. For context, my father was an abusive alcoholic. As is standard in that situation, there was a lot of yelling, etc and lead to a lot of negative energy. I noticed, as a result, more negative entities coming through my house. There was never a resident ghost, only passerbys. A few of note:  1. I had come home from school to find that an imp like creature (very small) had attached itself to my ankle. I was honestly just annoyed at it, and wanted it off of me. At some point I shook it off and told it to go away. I dont think it came inside my house, but it sure liked hanging around. 2. One day I found that the ghost of a young man, probably late 20s to early 30s, had found his way in my room. It hung out in the corner of my room. I was creeped out by this, especially because I could tell it wanted something, but had a hard time communicating. Day 2 or 3, I decide to take a selfie on my laptop and purposefully aimed it so the corner would be in view. I wanted to see if anything would come up. Of a few takes, one of them did capture something. I confirmed what I had been sensing and faintly seeing. There was a face in that corner, smiling for the camera as well. My heart sank. I didn't know what to do. Believing that the picture would imprint it's stay to be longer, I deleted the picture. Day 4, I finally felt sorry for it ...and asked it to go away. I couldn't help him, and I didn't want him in my room anymore. Surprisingly it actually went away within a few seconds. I felt the air get lighter and I didn't see or hear from that ghost again. I wonder if it needed a message to be passed along, or if it needed guidance to move on. But I was just a teenager, what could I do for it? 3. Once, my mother and I were in the house by ourselves. We had recently sold the house, and we were cleaning it up for the new owners. It was very empty, and was starting to get dark outside. I started to get a panicky feeling. One of those "get out now" feelings. So, I started urging my mother to finish up what she was doing and continue another time. I didn't want to freak her out, so I was just insistent we leave, without knowing exactly why. I look over in the direction of the living room from the kitchen, and I see this black mass of negative energy. It's overwhelming. If I were to describe it, it looked similar to the big bogged down river spirit from Spirited Away. The one that collected a bunch of stuff in it and got all gunky and gross. The one here reminded me of that, but instead of collecting junk, it collected negative energy. I froze for a second as I processed what the heck I just saw. At this point, night was falling and the sun was hardly out anymore. We had to use our flashlights on our phones to see. I told my mom we need to go, it's dark, and I don't feel safe. Finally, she was willing to leave, and as we were leaving I saw the black mass again leaving the house and going around to the back yard. My mom didn't see the creature I saw, but she did say she felt a presence, just ignored it as she was focused on finishing the kitchen.  &#x200B;  \- As a young adult, I have had a handful of interesting experiences as well outside of my childhood home.  1. I lived temporarily with my then boyfriend (now husband) in an apartment shared by a coworker of his and her boyfriend. I was in the apartment alone one day, and I got a weird feeling looking at the door to the not used room. I thought I heard noises, and felt a presence, but couldn't confirm. Later that week, I was home alone again, but this time I looked up at the bathroom door from my bedroom and saw a full bodied apparition of a young woman in white. She looked just as shocked as I did seeing her! She retreated to the other side of the bathroom wall - the empty, unused room. So, finally I ask my boyfriend's coworker if someone died in the apartment, and that I saw an apparition of a young woman. She told me yes, her name is Diana and she died in that room about a month before we moved in. My heart sank for Diana. The coworker told me that Diana had passed away suddenly in her room, I think from a health complication. The coworker was a bit freaked out and didn't know what to do about it. So, later ( I don't remember if it was later that night or the next day) I was in my room while my boyfriend and his coworker were at work. I decided to just talk to Diana out loud. I couldn't see her this time, but felt her presence. I talked to her like a person, realizing she might not have even realized she died since it was a sudden death. I told her that she had died, and that she needed to move on. That I felt sad for her that she was stuck, and I hope she can find the light. Shortly after that, I didn't feel her presence anymore. I think she moved on, and I really hope she found peace.  &#x200B;  2) Once I went to a historical tobacco plantation with my mom and a friend of mine. It was a little summer thing where we wanted to see some neat places in our area we didn't see yet.  I saw three apparitions here. Upon getting out of the parking lot, both me and my friend saw a shadow figure looking at us from the wooded area next to the parking lot. After we stared for a second, we both saw it essentially fly away while remaining vertical/upright..as if it were pulled back to wherever it came from. It was really weird. My mom missed it by still gathering her things from the car. Later, we were walking around the old slave's quarters house. The upper floor was condemned, but the stairs were still there. I noticed while the tour guide was talking about it, I looked at the stairs a little harder and saw the apparition of an older black man in overalls. He was faint, but here. I bowed respectfully at him, and continued the tour. As we left the building, I purposefully left last so I could tell him goodbye, like you would to any other person as a house guest. I felt bad for him, still stuck there for so long after slavery was abolished. The third apparition was in the Master's house. Almost immediately I picked up on a small girl, between 5-8 years old in period clothing complete with a standard bonnet. She followed us throughout the tour. At the last room of the house, the tour guide tells us this was an addition to the original building, and the room of the Master's daughter who had passed away from illness at about 7 or 8 years old. It hit me then that this was the little girl's room who had been following us around. Again, I purposefully left last so I could tell her thank you for letting me look at her house, again like nay other house guest would. I found it respectful to do so, and felt sorry for the little girl. I then went to the cemetery where her family was buried. I didn't sense anyone else, which made me even sadder that this little girl was probably stuck in her house waiting on her family, and somehow didn't move on.  &#x200B;  3) The last interesting story was also on a different plantation. This one is tucked away behind a major highway, and is considered a county park with petting animals. So, I went there with my husband and our daughter to see the animals and the park there. We did, however, get to go look at the exterior of the old houses there. In one of them, I noticed there was a man in butler like attire passing the window. I wondered if maybe it could've been a worker in period clothes for a tour or something...only to find that all the workers that day were in a polo shirt uniform, which is very different. I didn't see anyone else wearing period clothing either. Thus, while I can't confirm, I believe I may have seen an apparition that day as well.  &#x200B;  Those are my big ones I can recall right now. I hope others can relate to my experiences and know they aren't alone.  &#x200B;  Edited to Add:  I remembered a few more!  \- When I was about 16 or 17, my family dog passed away. I had her since I was little, so she was definitely a part of the family, and treated well throughout her life. She was an old girl, about 13 I think, and she had terminal lung cancer. The day came where she could barely move anymore, and we called the vet to put her down at home so she could go peacefully. After the vet left, we had an at-home funeral for our dog, and buried her with her favorite blanket and toys. My dad and my brother buried her, and me and my mom did something akin to a eulogy. It was when they were burying her that I sensed her spirit peeking around the corner of the house. I motioned her to come here, and she came quickly to my hand. I patted her quietly while no one else was watching. It was weird I'm sure for her to see us sad and burying her body. Later we were inside the house, and I saw my dog's spirit sitting next to my mom, who was crying on the couch. Her paw was on the couch next to my mom, as if she was saying "it's ok" to my mom. Later I told my mom what I saw, and she told me she thought she felt the dog's presence, and me saying what I saw confirmed for her. Afterwards for the few years left in that house, I would occasionally hear dog paw steps, and feel a dog's presence when there were no living dogs nearby. I did eventually get another dog, and occasionally she (another girl dog) would look at doors weird like someone was there, or also hear dog noises and want to find the other dog. I'm very certain that my childhood dog stuck around for awhile after her passing. I have since moved out of that house as mentioned before we sold the house, but I hope my dog moved on by now.  \- One more! This one is kinda weird. For a short while, I had sleep paralysis issues at about 15. Now, I know the theories on what we see and experience in this state being a hallucination since our body is confused on being awake vs asleep, so take this one as you will. I however, believe that this particular instance was paranormal related. This time felt different than other sleep paralysis episodes. Essentially, I was sleeping and had a deep dream. It was one of those dreams within a dream type thing. I don't remember how I got here, but I do remember towards the end of this dream I had come to a giant iron cell door, as if it was locking away a prisoner. I peeked inside through a sliding peephole like you see in prison doors, and saw a pale white, skinny humanoid. Think similar to Golem of LoTR, but more menacing feeling and totally bald. It saw me, and jumped at the peephole, which scared me awake. I was awake briefly, and I swear I heard an entity whisper in my hear, feeling their breath/vibrations from their voice " Go back to sleep". I did, and it felt like I got pulled all the way back into the deep dream state, right back to to the cell door. But whatever that thing was wanted out. It wanted me to help it. I sensed danger, and had this feeling that if it got out, that it would possess my body. So I woke right back up, but of course my body was still in sleep paralysis being that it's hard to go that deep asleep and be functional. So, I was awake, it was about 6am, and I'm paralyzed. I feel as if something is sitting on me, and isn't letting me up. (Which I'm told is somewhat common, and is rationalized by the body being in a depressed state). However, I feel this presence, whatever whispered to me, is on me, and I feel like it's staring me down, just waiting for me to go back to sleep. I fight it though, and stay awake, just looking around the room. I can't reach a light switch since my body still won't move, but I do notice the time and realize that the sun will come up soon. For some reason, my instinct tell some that with light this thing will go away. And, about 15-30 minutes later, the sun does rise and sunlight comes through my window - and with that the entity leaves, and I regain my bodily senses.  Of all the sleep paralysis episodes, this one was different in that I FELT someone talk to me in my ear after I woke up (which was not normal), that I felt a presence on me and staring at me, and that I happened to regain control of my body once that pressure was lifted once light filled the room. Normally I would regain control of my body between 5-10 minutes after waking up regardless of when the sun came up, and while I felt my body depressed, it did not usually feel like someone was sitting on me. Therefore I believe this one counts as a paranormal experience. Does anyone have an good stories of spooky experiences with a Ouija board? I just love reading them! Thanks! What is good?! I am doing a radio show for my college about ghost stories and I need some personal experiences. I figured this was the place to go! If you guys wanna share some encounters please do- give as much detail as possible as this is something that is probably going to be read aloud (with full credit to your Reddit User Name).   Thanks! I appreciate it! Good evening spookies! Fellow paranormal fan here.. I love listening to ghost stories and I’d love to tell short ghost stories on YT or TT in my spare time. If you wouldn’t mind, please post a short spooky tale below if you’d be happy for me to post it :) I can include your username or not whatever you’d prefer. Really appreciate it, I love this community so much and love that we all just want to share stories and live in a spooky realm!!   Peace. Love. Spooks.  Phee. Hi Everyone.... been running a ghost story site for many years but stories seem to have dried up.... if anyone would share their supernatural experiences with me, I'd be very grateful... ì will repost them on the site and you will help me keep it going...  &#x200B;  Thanks so much, If any of you would be so kind in sharing stories I’ll gladly share on the platform and shout you out !! Thanks for support I’ve lived in this house for almost 4 years now. At night for a while my bed would be in the corner of the room but facing the door. Every night without stopping I would feel a presence in the doorway, standing there watching me. No matter how many times I’ve turned on a light to see no one their in the hall, I always feel it watching me at night. I was robbed about a year ago and I was trying to destress and as I walk out of my room a girl looks up and stares at me! I think she’s one of the robbers but as I chased her out of the house, I reached the kitchen and before I go to open the door I see the door locked and a chair in front of the door the way I left it. To say the least I was scared but I didn’t act like it because if you show your fear that’s all they will feed upon. So I moved my bed to the other side of the room which made me put my full body mirror to the wall facing the door. I just wanted a different feel to try and feel better. The first night felt fine until I looked in the mirror and felt like I was about to see someone jump out of it. Lucky I fell asleep before anything like that could happen. A year later I’m still here. I feel them all the time but I never let them know. When they do things I pay them no mind. If I ever get out of this hell hole I’ll let you guys know. Until then, Hell-o from the Mover House.  (They like to move things- get it) If you have any questions I’m open to answering. And to people wondering why I do nothing this isn’t the first time I’ve seen ghosts and had to deal with them and it’s the smartest way for me to not make them angry or upset :) As a young man I loved to climb mountains. This is an amazing encounter that occurred to me on one climbing expedition. We had left a hut late one night. The intention was to summit a mountain in a single long push by climbing right through the night.  It was bad weather in the middle of winter and there was deep snow and we were trying to find our way through a maze of crevasses on a glacier. I remember the howling wind and clouds moving rapidly through the sky as the bulk of the mountain loomed over us. There was a full moon which would hide behind the clouds before emerging again.  I remember seeing a man moving up the slope from below us. The first thing that struck me was he didn't have a headlamp on. I yelled over the wind at my climbing partner. "Let's go talk to this guy." "What guy? " "THAT GUY" Pointing down at the figure moving toward us. "What guy??" At this point I remember losing it. That "F@#$&$# guy right there" And at that point I looked down to see absolutely nothing. Thinking he had fallen into a crevasse we walked down but we never found any tracks.  In the years since I have heard reports of similar encounters in that area. In fact recently the bones of a deceased climber from the 1970s were discovered melted out of the ice. The news report reminded me of my mysterious climber from that night. This is something my mother told me 12 years ago when I was home from college for the summer. It is also something she has never brought up again. I’m not 100% convinced of the existence of ghosts or the paranormal but this particular story has always stuck with me. She has never been the type to tell tall tales or exaggerate so I believe her experience to be genuine.  When my mother was 15 she used to babysit the 8 year old daughter of a close family friend (I don’t remember her name, but we’ll call her Emma). Her and my mother became close and she was basically like a little sister to my mom. Tragically, Emma lost her life when she suffered an asthma attack while riding horses with her family. As she was falling off the horse her foot got caught in the stirrup and she was dragged to death. Because they were such close friends, Emma was buried in my mother’s first communion dress.   A few days after the funeral, my mother was home alone one night while my grandparents where out to dinner and my uncle was out with friends. My mom was watching tv in her bedroom when she suddenly got the feeling that Emma was in the room with her. She never saw anything physically manifest, but the little girl’s presence was so overwhelming that it actually terrified her. She started to scream at Emma and asked her to please leave repeatedly. When the presence didn’t subside, my mom ran out of the house and stayed with a neighbor until my grandparents eventually came home. I still think about it because of how convinced she was that Emma was in the room with her. Gives me goosebumps every time.  Thoughts? Has something similar happened to anyone else? Hey yall! I host a podcast, Haunted HTX Podcast, where I share people's personal experiences with the paranormal! If you have a story you'd be interested in being shared on the podcast DM me or email me at [hauntedhtx@gmail.com](mailto:hauntedhtx@gmail.com). Feel free to check out the show on Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, Sticher or wherever you get your podcasts.I apologize for the poor writing quality. This is the first time since 2019 I have written all this down. I hope it interests you.  This story is real and is my personal experience. Names have been changed.  I joined the Army in 1990 and got out in 1998 when I hit my mid-life crisis; I joined the national guard. A few (more than a few) years after joining the guard I was voluntold I was getting reassigned to a medical unit that was deploying to the middle east. In Jan 2019 I reported to my new unit and learned that in addition to deploying at the end of the year I would have to go through an NTC rotation with the unit.   What a joy, NTC for those who don’t know The National Training Center (NTC) is in the middle of the California Desert. It’s one of the most challenging training events the army has and is as close to hell as we can get on this ball of dirt, or so I think anyway.   Skipping ahead, our rotation at NTC was scheduled to back up to our deployment, meaning we had to deploy our equipment from Ft Irwin, instead of shipping it home. So, after 30 days in the desert, I got to watch my unit load up on buses and head home for a month while I got to stay at Ft Irwin and deal with packing, customs inspections, and inventories. Out of around 5000 guardsmen that made up the force deploying around 300 of us had to stay behind.   Because units don’t typically have to “deploy” Ft Irwin struggled to find a place for us to stay. The Rotational Unit locations were needed for the next unit that was coming in to do some training in the desert, and the National Guard barracks on the post were needed for California Guardsmen who were doing their two weeks annual training that summer. So, after moving around a bit, we landed in what is known as “Augmentee Billeting”.  This is where units that come in not to train but to assist the post-full-time “opposition force” stay. Lucky for us there were no augments needed for the upcoming training, so we got to use these barracks for three weeks.   This is where my story begins.   The work we needed to do was long and hard, but after two weeks most of the heavy lifting was done, and we started to enjoy some downtime. This coincided with our move to the Augmentee housing. When we first moved the housing manager, a civilian, walked the Sr. leaders through the 12 buildings we were to occupy and the bathrooms we were allowed to use.  The setup was typical for Army short-term housing, each building had two sides with bunk beds from front to back. The 12 buildings we occupied along with some others were arranged in a square with large bathrooms and open shelters for a meeting, eating etc. in the area behind the buildings.   Each unit had its buildings, and my unit had the one the furthest from the assigned male bathroom. This was odd because directly behind our building was a male bathroom. But it was locked, and it was not on the list to be assigned to us. Being older I asked the Housing Manager we could get that one assigned as well. Being older I must use the facilities more often, and I did not want half to walk across the pad to the one male bathroom we had. He said “unfortunate that one is not available” which I took to mean it had maintenance issues. Just my luck.      Fast forward a few days, and I was coming back from dinner with my team in Barstow CA. It was late and when we arrived there was an MP (Military Police) car parked in front of the building next to ours.  Being sensitive to issues with the National Guard and the Active duty I decided to walk to the smoking area behind the building with the MP to see if I could find out who had messed up and what we could do to avoid paperwork.   When I got to the end of my building and started to the smoking pit, I swear I heard a scream and running water from the locked bathroom.  However, I also so one of our senior females talking to an MP at the smoking pit while I looked at the bathroom as I walked by, I was more interested in finding out what was up with the MP.   When I reached the female NCO I knew, she immediately said “you heard that right”? I said heard what the scream? Yes, she said “it’s been going on for half an hour. Looks like someone broke into that bathroom and is tearing up the place.” Great I taught, someone got drunk and is going to get arrested please don’t let it be one of my guys.   I turned to the MP and introduced myself; I asked if she had been into the bathroom yet and if she had any idea who was inside. She kind of laughed and said, no, both doors still have their locks, so I’m waiting for my NCOIC to get here with the key.  About that time two additional MP’s arrived, and one said “let’s get this over with” and they all started towards the bathroom. The senior MP turned to me and said Sir do you and the sergeant mind going to wait at the other door?  I said we’re not equipped to deal with some drunk; that’s your job. He laughed and said no worries; I don’t think anyone will come out that side, more a precaution if you don’t mind. Satisfied I walked to the sidewalk so I could see the back door. The noise from the bathroom was getting worse. It was clear all the showers where on from the steam, you could hear toilets flushing and what I assume was stall doors banging.   The MP’s gave me a thumbs up as they went to unlock the padlock on the door. Suddenly, and I presumed when they opened the door, all the noise stopped; all we could hear was the water running, and then the MP’s giving the “Military Policy” yell as they entered. Shortly after that, we could hear them yelling clear as they moved down the building and cleared areas. When they got to the end of the building, I was on they started turning off the showers and moving back towards the other door.   I went to the front door wanting to see who they brought out. As they came out the senior guy told his subordinates to make sure power was off and lock up. He asked me and Prylor (the Master sergeant who had originally called in the disturbance) to walk with him. When we go back to the smoking area, he said, “We didn’t find anyone inside.” I was indigent, clearly someone had been in the bathroom, and I said that imposable. He held his hands up and said Sir, this is not the first time this has happened. Every few months we get calls that someone is messing around over here, when we get here, we search and clear the building and find nothing but running showers and if the bathroom has supplies, they will be thrown all over. But we never find anyone inside. I don’t have an explanation for it, but from what I understand this has been going on for years. There is a standing order that no MP’s go into that bathroom alone, and at least one of the MP’s doing a search must be male. What the “F” I said, why is that? He said he was not sure but from what he had heard a female MP had had unexplained injuries when she searched the bathroom alone.   In my mind, I said this is bullshit, just the Active army messing with the Guard again. The MPs left, and MSG Prylor and I talked for a bit; she was originally from Louisiana and joined the NC guard when she got out of the Army at Ft Bragg. I told her I thought this was a bullshit prank by the MPs. She was not so sure, she said she taught it was supernatural. I was not convinced.   Three additional times during our stay people reported hearing noises, screaming, and running water from that building. Each time the response was the same. Three MPs would search the building and find no one.    When it came time to clear the building, I asked the Housing manager for a moment when we were done. He looked at me and said you have questions about the bathroom, right? Well yes, I said. He looked at me and said, “I need a cigarette walked with me to my truck.”   This is what he told me. In 2009 a soldier who was doing an augmentation mission from Ft. Hood committed suicide in that bathroom. Sadly, this is not uncommon, soldier suicide is at an all-time high. After his death, the housing team started getting reports of issues in the bathroom. The first incidents were with the stall door, the one where the soldier died, which would not stay on its hinges.  They would get calls nearly daily that the door had fallen off. Only to find it undamaged and laying on the floor. Then during the period of no units using the building, they would come to open it only to find the door off and on the floor with the showers running.   A few years later he said the MPs started getting calls; some were screams and yelling in the bathroom, some were of people being punched while showering, etc. In 2012 the building maintenance team and the MPs decided to leave the building locked. While it took one bathroom away, it was not worth the constant hassle of dealing with the calls.   That’s when the “someone is trashing the bathroom” calls started. Early on MPs would get the key and search the building, turn off the showers, and lock it back up. However, one night a female MP got the call. She arrived went in and was beaten, somewhat badly. After a long investigation, no one was ever charged with her assault. The MP herself said she did not see her attacker, but that punches came from all directions. This is when the unofficial policy of “three MP’s and at least one male on the team started.   He looked at me and said Sir, I don’t believe in spooks and stuff, but whatever is in there, it scares me.   I’ll be honest, whatever is in there scares me too.   &#x200B;  [Augmentee Billiting FT Irwin CA \(Subject Bathroom Circled\)](https://preview.redd.it/4v0zm34qwfp91.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f793e3e83861c0294befb5144f2499614a0ae2) In December of 2020, a being told me of specific events that would unfold, which have thus far. This being woke me saying, “Watch me turn on the light.” I opened my eyes and saw a semi-transparent limb stretch up to my ceiling fan and pull the cord, turning on my light. While I was lying in bed, this being told me what would soon occur, saying “Try to survive.” These experience are not the first I have had communicating with spirits. The first dream I had in which a spirit interacted with me was as a child dreaming of my deceased brother. Before he visited me in a field, smiling and breathing his soul into my mouth, I had no idea he ever existed. He told me in my dream of his death, and to ask my mother about it. His words echoed in my head as I woke up. I walked into her living room and asked her about him, whom she had never mentioned to me before. She turned white and asked how I knew. Okay, so this is a story that happened with me and two of my friends while we were at a  night out in the school. My school was having a slumber party.  At night, exactly at like 1:30 am, me and both of my friends, felt like we needed to go and pee. So we went to the washroom, relieved ourselves, and agreed that none of us felt sleepy. So, we decided to explore the entire school. There are two buildings in our campus. We went in the one which is near the cemetery. We thought that we won't see anything. As soon as we entered the building, we started getting bad vibes. Felt like we must turn our backs and return to the building where all of the other students were. But we were an adventurous trio. We decided to defy the odds and explore the building. What could possibly happen? We will hear footsteps? See some huge stuff getting thrown in front of us? Nope. None of these. We started hearing someone talking. We thought that there must an another group,exploring,but no. Suddenly, the temperature of the place suddenly fell down. Like 0 degrees Celsius even though it was summer. Then, we heard a loud female scream. So loud, that we thought that the students in the other building might here it. We even started feeling that whatever screamed, was coming running towards us. We turned our backs and ran as fast as we could. Upon reaching the other building, a teacher who was with all of us asked us why we came running so fast out of the next building. We told him everything that happened, but he said that he didn't hear any scream. We thought that it might have been an imagination. The next day, one of my friends who accompanied me into the building got a couple of scars on his stomach and chest. He even fell insanely ill.  Felt like sharing this experience here, with you guys. Thank you. I'm also going to share a real quick story that happened a few years ago.  My husband and I went to visit his mother at her friend's house out in the country not too far where we live. This house is old, to me, looked like 1930s, but might be older. Filled with antiques. The story is that the previous owner (years and years ago) actually died upstairs, but I can't remember how, I think just from old age.  There was this huge antique mirror in the living room and I was just looking at (well, looking at myself in it because vanity lol) when all of a sudden I feel something poke me behind my neck. Like a bony finger just slowly poke me at back of the base of my skull.  Freaked me out. I turned around and asked my husband  and mother in law had they touched me, and they said no. Which I figured they hadn't, because I would have seen it in the mirror.  It was like something was taunting me for looking in the  mirror. Maybe whoever owned the mirror or whoever it was that died in the house. This just happened. My wife sent me a text to come in the room because she was to freaked out to yell out for me while she was putting our baby to sleep. We have a tv in the room that’s not to old but doesn’t have the voice option on our remote. She was watching Grey’s Anatomy and I didn’t here it at first. It sounded like someone was talking outside of our window and I listened closer I can here a deep voice coming from the tv. As I sat there I can here the tv talking but as I watch the subtitles I can tell it was a entirely different conversation going on. She keeps the volume fairly low and the subtitles on. I grab the remote control to turn up the volume and the deep voice said “good to see you. You look exactly the same”. In a dark manor. Than my older son approach to room and as I was trying to rationalize what’s going on. So in a panic I shut it off because he is only eight and had a couple scares already that freaked me out a while ago. Just wanna know your guys thought and if it happens again I’m gonna record. Sorry in advance for my grammar and punctuation but this happens literally two minutes ago so I’m kind of freaked out. This just happened and I’m not entirely sure how to feel or what to think. I’ve had a few ghost / strange / bizarre experiences before and seen one ghost very clearly in 2008. I’m not phased by much, these experiences are very rare and I barely think of them. I feel very comfortable in my home and have lived here for 1.5 years now. I live in a large studio, don’t own any pets, the bedroom area directly connects to the front door hallway and bathroom. I’ve spent the day relaxing and seeing family, then lay down in bed just reading articles online / watching TV. I just got up to walk down the hallway (2.5 metres total length), as I turned into the hallway I very clearly saw and felt a cat walking alongside the skirting board which I nearly tripped on. I gasped and shook immediately (still have goosebumps and trying to get my heart rate down). It took me a few seconds to realise this was a ghost. I’ve never heard of an animal ghost before, has anyone had an experience like this? It honestly nearly tripped me up. It took a few minutes to get my breathe back, I also went pale. I grew up with two silver cats (who would be dead now) but this didn’t feel like one of those cats. I also live directly next to a vet, so now I’m thinking maybe a cat passed on in that vet office and is lingering now in my apartment / building? I honestly don’t know what to think, I’m not scared but it gave me the shock of a lifetime trying to get my balance. Any ideas what this is? Nothing much is coming up on google. Thanks    Hello everyone  My name is Walter and I’m a enthusiast of supernatural thing, I already had some experience that soon I want to tell here, but now I want to tell and show something that just happened to my brother, first I’d like to say that I’m not so good to white in English even though all this time living here, I’m still taking some classes, I’m originally from Brazil but I live in Los Angeles since 2015.  Ok, let me start, my brother is 7 years older than me, he works for a Paper And Cellulose company, I think this company is the biggest of one of them in the world, so it has a lot money and when it started been building they started to buy all farms around the city and surrounded cities to plante eucalyptus, for those who don't know, they make paper with eucalyptus wood. My brother works driving that big tractor 🚜 that I don’t know the name in English, it has something like a claws, to stack the eucalyptus trunks, he works in a rotating shift, sometimes day sometimes during the night.  He told me once that something farms are old, they have cemetery, and the eucalyptus plantation surrounds the cemetery and sometimes he works at night close to it, he doesn’t like, well, last week he was work at night in one of this farms very haunted according some of his friends that already saw some weird things, it was a crew of 4, 3 machine tractor 🚜, and one mechanic to support if one of the tractor breaks down. Now let me say exactly what my brother said.  He said he was working and the mechanic was close to him inside the truck 🛻, my brother was like watching him I notice that he was weird, he was inside the truck, get off holding the cell phone and start to walking straight behind the eucalyptus stacks that we can see on the picture, my brother said he wondered what was going on, and thought he went behind the stack to poop 💩 😂, ok so my brother got off the tractor to talk to the mechanic, and he said to my brother that he was in the car when suddenly he saw someone walking, he focused his flashlight and saw the woman and took the picture, she kept walking and the moment that my brother saw him walking, the guy said he put his cellphone to record and went after her but she disappeared. I love this picture because looks so clear, and I like more because my brother was witness.  Thanks everyone, I hope u understand my English.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1qs1pc6kgcp91.jpg?width=924&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=772191bf73670cbb0c2ec9d51edc9fb1ee3cb4d2 Previously I've shared a story about a ghost of a little girl that was humming in my room when I was 18. I'll go ahead and share another ghost story that happened just last year, while me, my husband, and family were on vacation.  My family rented a cabin in Helen Ga, which was 3 stories tall, and was pretty much right in the center of town. We stayed for a week, and about 3 days in our stay weird things started to happen. My aunt and grandma (who stayed on the second floor, along with my mom and dad, who had their own room) started hearing things. They said they heard a little girl crying, at night. I didn't pay much attention to it (my aunt and grandma are pretty jumpy when it comes to staying in new places, I thought they just heard a tv going because there was a TV in each of our rooms).  4 days into the trip. My aunt and mom are sitting on the couch and they hear a girl say in a very distressed and breathy voice "Mama". My mom yelled for me, I was out on the porch of the cabin, and asked if I hollered for her, which of course I didn't. Now my mom, grandma AND aunt were all scared. They were afraid to be left alone in any part of the cabin by themselves. I tried not to pay attention to it because we were on vacation, I wanted to have a good time hanging out at the cabin, and wanted to have a good night's sleep, lol. So thinking about ghosts just wasn't on my mind.  Until that night. My husband and I had the top room of the cabin. We turned off the TV and went to sleep after a long day of walking around town. I woke up out of a dead sleep and I start hearing a girl cry. Small moaning sobs. I went real quiet, stopped breathing to hear if it was just my mind, or my ears playing tricks on me because I'm thinking it might be one of my family members' tvs playing. Nothing. The sounds was definitely coming from inside the room. I went back in my mind about 6 years ago to when the ghost of a little girl started humming in my room, and the fear and panic of that experience flew over me again.  I grabbed the smart tv's remote and turned it to some cartoon or movie and turned up the volume. Like it was pretty loud, my husband turned over to complain how loud it was, and asked me to turn it off. "ABSOLUTELY not, I'm not turning it down or off" He got agitated and asked me why did I have it so loud, I told him I would explain in the morning. The sobs eventually died out over the sounds of the tv.  The next day I told my husband what happened, and told him we only have 2 nights left, that I'm going to leave the tv on loud, to just get ready for it. I was afraid to hear the little girl cry again. To be honest I was so upset about it, I was ready to just up and go home.   So the next night passes and the tv was kept on and loud. Nothing that night except mine and my husband's ears hurting and a sleepless night.  The last night was a doozy. I was so tired that I went straight to sleep and left my husband watching TV, but I asked him to please, before he went to sleep, to start a movie or whatever and keep the volume up. He promised and I went to sleep. Then I woke up again out of a deep sleep to the sound of how quiet it was and the panic shot threw me. The tv wasn't on. And I can't swear on the Bible, but I think I could hear the little girl crying again. I looked at the tv and it had on the screen something to do with "playback" issues, it was a smart tv with the roku. So I was doing everything I could, the remote buttons wouldn't work and I was freaking out. Like it wouldn't let me move out of the "error" screen. So I somehow had to restart the tv to get it to come back on and actually PLAY something. After fiddling around with it for more than I would care to, it actually started up and let me scroll to a movie to play, and once again the volume was turned up. I think whatever was in that cabin, had something to do with trying to stop the tv playing.  I was happy this was our last night in the cabin.  I will never stay in Helen, Georgia ever again. so this happened when i was like ten. i moved into a house that was fairly new and was built less then a year from when we moved in. we were renting it because we were building a house somewhere else.  there is a lot that happened but i will be brief with the regalur things that we witnessed. doors would open, lights flicker, a clock that didn't work for 20 years with no battaries starting dinging. even my little music box started playing and that was real creepy.  this all started happening like 2 weeks after my pop died, so we thought it was him. but one day when my mom was at work, her coworker claimed to speak and sometimes see spirits, dropped a tray full of food in shock. she froze. my mum and the other coworkers asked what was up. the lady said that a spirit was hovering over my mum and then left, but with no bad intentions. she said it was in human form. the lady discribed the spirit and it matched the exact disscription of my babcia-great grandma-. we were confused. we then thought it was her. but you will soon see that we were likely wrong.  my most bizzare incounture was on a school morning. i walked into a the pantry (a small room thing) to grab some toast out of the toaster, which is at the other end of the pantry. i was walking out wheni felt something behind me. i turned around but kept walking, which i wouldnt normally do, but because of this i was safe, because three flipp'n glass trays came flying at me and smashed. i just missed. my first thought was "oh my god that is the coolest thing that has ever happened to me!"  looking back i am more horrorfied but still think it was interesting.  also we later found out after we moved out that it was built over an Aboriginal burial ground. (i live in Australia). we were annoyed that they built over that.  sorry for bad spelling I’ve been slowly sharing my paranormal experiences on Reddit.   December 23, 2000. I just flew in from college for winter break. It was a late arrival and had to drive close to an hour home from the airport. After spending sometime catching up with my mom and grandma (who were always night owls), I decided I needed to sleep. My room shared with my sister had been left unchanged. She was not there that night. It is now early morning Christmas Eve.    To set the scene, this house and room are small. It’s a very small one level ranch home. The room was a box big enough for one twin bed on one side of the room and my twin bed on the other. Offset parallel, set up that the heads/pillow area were opposite of each other and the ends of the beds overlap by a few feet. Basically a head to toe format. There is approx 2-3” between the beds.    Anyway, from my bed I can see out the door, down the hallway where our bathroom was and I could see just past that to beginning of the dining room. My mom and grandma stayed in the family room with the tv on and this is just by the dining room.  Again, small house you can hear everyone and everything with little effort.   Anyway, I roll to my side and look over to the corner where my sister’s head would normally be on her pillow. I see this odd white glow in the corner over her bed.  I stay to watch because I get this sense it’s ok, only love. In the past with any paranormal event I usually noped right out of there or was afraid. This white glow is in the shape of what I believe is an angel. I can see that’s it’s tall, the head, wings (not expanded) outline, then I see a figure that is standing in front of it. This figure is white and glowly as well, but I can see two separate shapes.  It steps out, places it’s hands together in a prayer sign and bows. It backs up and it disappears.   Well reality sets in with wth did I just see…frozen now that fear is taking over…I yell for my grandma..……”grandma…..” “what?” “Can you turn the hall light on? I just saw a ghost”. She turns the hall light on and I remember her saying “20 years old and still believes in ghost and needs a light on.”  I felt mad at that point. For mocking me for believing in something she has had experiences with. Yes it was the family that say they believe in ghost but the minute one of us “kids” would have an experience it was not credible and just our imagination.   I fell asleep and was awoken around 6am to the phone ringing.   It was an unexpected call and I hear my grandma talking to the caller and begin crying. Her uncle had unexpectedly passed away in the night after having minor surgery to remove a small patch of skin carcinoma.  He was in his late 70s. This was her favorite and closest uncle. The only one I knew that she spoke with. Now looking back it makes sense since they were only about 10 years apart in age.  I never met him since he lived a few states away.  Funny to only know someone by a few mail correspondences and phone conversations.  My grandma would go visit him as a break from us.   I remember she spent most of Christmas Eve mourning in her bedroom. Family comes over in the evening which are her sons, my uncles. I’m in my room and they are at the dining room table talking and I heard my name mentioned and begin listening.  I hear my grandma talk about a 20 year old seeing things and needing her grandma to turn the light on. They all laugh.  And then I hear my one uncle call for me.  I go out to them knowing what they were just talking about.  He asks me to tell them what I saw. I tell them. Right as I was finishing my grandma shoots up and runs to her room and slams the door. She is crying.   The focus is off me and my one uncle is at her door asking what is wrong. She lets my uncle in. About 20 minutes later he comes out and tells my other uncle and I very seriously that my grandma is upset because she just figured it out. Her uncle came to say good bye to her. The angel arrived the same time her uncle died, in the room she slept in when her uncle last visited many years ago, and his way of saying good bye was with the prayer hands and bow. (There was no way I would have known his way of saying good bye was with the prayer hands and a bow since I never met him in person).   This is my story of how I saw an angel and someone saying goodbye to their loved ones. I feel like I robbed my grandma of one last good bye.  By chance, I was the one available to listen.I've experienced a lot of paranormal incidents, but most can be pretty easily dismissed. However, this was the most concrete account I've ever had.  I was spending the night at a friend's house. We were either toward the end of our high school years or just beginning college. As per usual, we were lying in her bed, talking. I was resting on my back, staring at the ceiling as we did this. At some point during our conversation, I noticed an oddly shaped shadow in the middle of her ceiling. It appeared to be circular with what I likened to tentacles protruding from it, which were moving much like a jellyfish's. Trying to rationalize what it could be, I turned my head to look outside of her window. It was late at night. There was a bush that grew next to her window. I at first thought the shadow might just be coming from that, but I noticed the branches weren't moving. With a sickening feeling, I looked toward the shadow again. It was still there. I finally decided to ask my friend, Chris, if she saw the shadow, too.  She asked, "The one on the ceiling? With the tentacles?" I confirmed. "Yeah. There are a bunch around like that, but it's the only one that has those tentacles."  The fact that she saw it, too, almost made the situation more terrifying. It got even worse, though, because as soon as she acknowledged its existence, the shadow began to move toward us across the ceiling. The shadow actually reached the point where the ceiling met the wall where our heads were resting, but Chris snapped her fingers and pointed toward the center of the room. "She doesn't want you over here. Go back to the center." And it did.  Chris swore up and down that these shadow entities were good. She recounted an evening when she had a bad feeling about her mother, whose room was across the hall. She was frightened something had happened to her but couldn't muster the courage to go look for herself. Instead, she asked these entities to go check on her mother for her. She claimed they slid across the walls and ceiling until the got to the doorframe, materialized into a shadowperson, and left the room. She also said she felt relieved afterward, no longer frightened for her mother.  I, on the other hand, had been practically frozen with fear. It had all seemed like bad juju to me. I suggested maybe they were deceptive, but she wrote that off. At the time, I was Christian (I'd now describe myself as an agnostic spiritualist), and I prayed over the house. She made the comment a few weeks later that she hadn't seen them since then, but they eventually returned. Maybe they truly were harmless and I was simply being closed minded, but I just didn't feel right when I saw that thing. To this day, I still wonder what it was and what it wanted. This is a rewrite/repost of a true story that I wrote and deleted a while back.   About thirty years ago I spent several years working in movie theaters in Worcester, Massachusetts. My favorite was the huge old building that had been chopped up into four separate cinemas. It had been a beautiful theater back when it was built in 1926 as the Poli Palace.   Although it had been semi-destroyed during modernization in the late 50s, there were still many original features of the building that remained. As a manager, I had been issued a big keychain that gave me access to the entirety of the building, and I spent countless hours exploring nearly every part of that building (except the curtain loft, which would have required climbing an iron ladder about 80 feet. Nope.)  The building had attics and basements and crawl spaces. There was an area in the front of the the building on the second floor that had two or three abandoned businesses that had been walled off. There was a music store and a ballet studio, and maybe an office. There was also a bathroom. Everything looked like it was from the 1940s or 50s. Faded wallpaper with ballerina motif, a peeling mirror on the wall.   In another section of the building was the old managers office with high ceilings and crown molding and a beautiful stained glass window that I believe dated back to 1912 and had previously been part of an adjacent theater. There was still an old safe in the office. I found a newspaper article in the public library from 1942 or ‘44 that detailed an armed robbery when two men had tied up the managers in the office and robbed the safe. (One of those men was later executed in the electric chair for an unrelated crime.) We used the old managers office to store giant 30-gallon bags of popcorn.   There was a sort of crawl space under the box office that was accessible by lifting a hinged plywood panel and climbing over a four-foot wall. On the other side were the remains of a couple of basement rooms with broken concrete and bricks strewn about. In one of those rooms I found an old flared Coca-Cola glass in perfect condition. I kept it for years. I also found a deck of cards in a handmade leather pouch with a snap closure fashioned out of a buffalo nickel.   There were also old dressing rooms with makeup mirrors and lightbulbs. The paint was peeling off the walls in potato-chip sized flakes.   As you can surmise, the building was purported to be haunted. The head manager claimed to have had ghostly experiences. I’ll start there, I guess.   When the building was remodeled in the late 1950s, the men’s room in the basement was converted into the manager’s office. One night while closing up, the manager (my boss) made his way up the stairs to the main lobby. As he emerged, something caught his eye. Way up by the ornate 30 foot ceiling he saw an apparition floating there. It disappeared into the ceiling. Terrified, he ran back down the stairs and hid in the office until daylight.   Another time, he was again working late. There were several arcade machines in an area of the lobby, and they were normally powered-off when the last shows were in. As he climbed the stairs, he heard all of the machines making their electronic bleeps and bloops. He was annoyed that the usher had failed to turn off the machines before punching out, and realized that he’d have to go turn them off himself. As soon as he opened the door the noises stopped dead. Looking across the lobby from where he emerged, the machines were all dark. They were indeed powered off.   A projectionist claimed that he looked out of the booth window one night in the big theater upstairs while shutting things down and saw a face looking in at him.   I take those stories with a grain of salt. I was always skeptical of those based on the sources.   Here’s my experience.   I was obsessed with the history of the building, and would research newspaper archives for articles about it. There were rumors that a stagehand had died there in an accident during the time that it had been a vaudeville theater. I was never able to confirm that.   I had talked about the building to my mother and she in turn happened to discuss it with a woman that she worked with. That woman claimed to be psychic or clairvoyant or maybe just that she would get “feelings” about things. She told my mother that she had been to that theater, and that she felt that someone had indeed been killed there, and that his name began with the letter “M”. My reaction was “Huh. Okay, sure. She sounds nutty.”  Sometime later, I was the sole manager on duty on a slow night mid-week. I was alone in the office in the basement. The seven o’clock shows were in, and I was doing paperwork. The intercom buzzed. It was the box office cashier calling to tell me that I had a phone call. I asked who it was, and she said that she didn’t know.   I hung up the intercom and pushed the button for the main incoming line where the call was holding. The earpiece erupted with loud, close squealing and static. I use the word “close” because it was so loud and distinct that I assumed that it was something wrong with the phone PBX in our building rather than the line itself or the caller’s phone. It was just the impression that I had.   “Hello?”, I said.   Nothing. Just more squealing and static.   “Hello?”, I repeated.   “Hello.” A man’s voice. Calm, flat. Distinct. Then nothing further.   “Who is this?” I was a bit perplexed. All of the noise on the line and the caller seemingly reluctant to speak.   “This is Mike.” Calm, quiet. Not shouting over the noise of the line. Quite audible and clear. Then nothing but the awful squealing and static.  I waited a few seconds for the caller to continue. After all, he called me. Presumably there was a reason. Nothing.   “Mike WHO??”, I said, feeling a little impatient. Mike is a common name, and there were two Mikes employed there at the time. One of them had a fairly high-pitched voice that sounded nothing like the caller. It didn’t sound like the other Mike either.   The line abruptly went dead. Silent. The squealing and hissing stopped. I waited. No one called back.   I called Sandy, the box office cashier and asked her if they asked for me personally or just to speak to the manager. She said that the caller had asked for me by name.   Suddenly I remembered my mother’s friend. A man’s name beginning with the letter “M”.   Mike.   It never happened again and the phone never made those noises. No one ever confessed to a prank. I never figured out who it was. I don't post on things but I need answers. So last night I don't know what happened but, It's either my door glitched, or there's a ghost possessing my door but, yesterday I was sitting on my bed and the door randomly opened and closed. The fan wasn't on, my dog was downstairs sleeping and my father was also downstairs watching a movie. My mother was at work so it couldn't have been her. It wasn't even that late, It was around 9:20 pm, a time where weird things would usually happen. For example, when I was watching a movie with my father, I could see the lights flickering on and off in the dining room. We didn't have any problems with the electricity and my mother was also at work at the time. And when I was younger I would see a dog sitting somewhere in my house, and I thought it was my dog so I always got close to it, and before I could even come within 6 feet, it would disappear and I would find my dog sitting in the kitchen. I also saw a tall man with a long black trench coat, black boots, and a tall black top hat, he didn't have a face either. I would usually see him turning the corner so me, a stupid kid, decided to try and chase him. And when I turned the corner, he was gone. I stopped seeing him after I turned 6. I sometimes see the dog still but it disappears after I blink. As I had gotten older I started to feel like someone was standing over me as I slept, luckily I had a eye mask on so I could open my eyes without seeing whatever was standing over me, but I could just sense it, just staring at me. Eventually I would fall asleep and the feeling of anxiety would go away. The next morning I would pretend like nothing happened and go along with my day. I never told anyone this until now because I thought that people would think I was crazy. Sometimes when I would watch a scary movie, I would have sleep paralysis and it would feel like I was being watched by a dark figure, sometimes it would be at the foot of my bed, or it would be right next to me,  watching, and staring into my skull. I leave a light on  because I'm scared of the dark because of these feelings, thinking whatever had watched me in my sleep would return. I used to have dreams full of life and color but now, it's just a black void. I can't talk, move, or hear anything, it's just a pitch black void with nothing in it. I've tried using dream catchers and protection charms, and evil eyes but nothing will work. I'm thinking about getting a priest to come bless my house, or an exorcist to get rid of whatever is in my house. My mother told me that I would randomly look up from my toys and speak to something that wasn't there, I never had an imaginary friend so she thought I was just talking to the birds in the attic, but even when the birds had moved out of our attic, I would still do this. Even as I'm typing this I feel paranoid, and I feel like someone's watching me. Update: Right now I'm in the master room, it's 8:37 and I have heartburn, I've had done most of the things that people have said and I don't think it's worked, I'm just going to try something that has worked for my grandparents and I'm going to see if they'll accept it. Update: I decided to try and offer the ghost something and I don't know if they accept it or not, but, they did leave a really fancy looking K on my floor using string. Is this a sign? Update: Well, this isn't exactly an update but oh well. Let me get some things cleared up, 1. I am not a Christian 2. I'm talking about my Japanese grandparents, and even if they are atheists, they still respect the dead, the reason why I'm offering the ghost something is to try and get to some agreement. I'm not giving the ghost anything that will possibly increase it's power, I'm simply putting some things like a Snickers bar, something to eat. Please understand that, thank you. So I release episodes for my podcast on Monday and Fridays, ya know, good start to the week and a good end or something to listen to while you're getting ready to go out out. Well, it dawned on me that Halloween this year is a Monday!!!! I would love to do an episode dedicated to peoples ghost stories if they dont mind sharing. A buddy of mine has started experiencing strange events and he is terrified. My friend, lets call him R bought a civil war musket ball dug up from the battle field of bull run. R is really into the civil war and wanted a piece from one of the battels. He bought the musket ball on Monday. He started hearing knocking on Thursday even though it was late and every body was fast asleep other than him. He didn't think much of it till the next day. Friday night he was laying in bed when all of the sudden he heard the knocking again. He pulled out his phone and started recording immediately when his mucket ball and custom dog tags fell off the shelf. Right after they hit the floor he heard a swift "hey" sounding like an older mans voice he didn't recognize. A few minutes after the "hey" he heard heavy foot steps coming from his attic. No one ever goes in his attic because it has thin floors and is to far out of the way for them to store anything up there. He sent all of us friends the video to see if we heard the same thing as him. We all agreed that we heard the footsteps and the distinct "hey". tonight in an Xbox party we were talking about what he had heard trying to figure out what it was. He decided it was late and he was going to get some sleep while we stayed on a bit longer. 15 minutes later he comes back in complete tears and tells us that he was lying in bed when he saw his doorhandle turn his lights cut off at the switch and the door opened almost all the way. R is not the type of person to shoe fear or when he cries but he was crying in complete fear. He is scared for his life and is not sure how to get rid of this thing, whatever it is. He is extremally religious and has put a cross on the musket ball and is holding a cross on his chest while he goes to sleep. Can anyone help to maybe get rid of whatever this thing is. Hello everyone my name is Dalton I’m 28 years old. When I was about 22 I had was having a really hard time I had just lost my job and my younger sister had gotten into a bad car accident and was on life support and they thought she was brain dead and didn’t expect her to survive. I was taking the bus back and forth from the hospital. My sister had been in the hospital on life support for about two weeks at this point. One night I was leaving the hospital for the night and it was pretty late probably around 8 or 9 pm and I was sitting at the bus stop on a bench with my head in my hands and I was just lost. After sitting there for about 5 minutes and I smelled a sulfur like smell then felt someone tap me on the shoulder. I looked up and saw a young woman standing beside me she looked to be about my age at the time so 21 or 22. She was very pretty she was pale she had long straight blonde hair and blue eyes. She was very professionally dressed she she was wearing a black suit, black pants and black dress shoes. She asked if she could sit down and I said yes then said that I looked sad and asked what was wrong. I told her everything and she patted me on the shoulder and said everything was going to  be ok. Then my bus pulled up I stood up to get on the bus but before I got on I turned around to thank her and when I turned around she was gone. There was no way she could have been gone that fast. I thought it was very strange but nice and I just got on the bus home. The next morning I got a frantic call from my mother and she told me that my sister had woken up. I immediately went to the hospital and when I got there they had taken the breathing tube out and she was talking. About two weeks later she walked out of the hospital with no lasting damage and all the doctors said it was a miracle and they had never seen anything like it. A week after she was released from the hospital my old job called and rehired me. I don’t know exactly what the woman was but I wish I could see her again to thank her. Let me know what you guys think she might have been. Are school won’t believe us no matter how much students can tell them.It was a normal day all of us were going to are locker to get are books,Me and about 30 other girls have a locker in the locker room.There was a girl who was gonna go into the stalls in are locker room and the bathroom is out of site from the lockers.We start getting are books but next thing you know the girl screamed at the top of her lungs,we all were going to see what happens and then we saw IT.There was a little girl hanging from the ceiling another little girl hiding in a stall and a man. The two little girls were both in white dresses,the “man” was very tall and he had a hat like a magicians hat.After we figured out what was happening we all started running and screaming some had to be dragged out since they were rocking back and forth.Also a part I forgot to mention is that only about 30-40% saw the man.Anyways when we all got out of there 4 girls got locked in.Most of us were prying the door open and we got it.I was one of the people who was comforting one of the four girls and then she yelled “They started running towards us“ we all went pale to her saying that.Another girl was so scared she started vomiting.I still feel bad for those girls I know all 4 of them all 4 girls were in 6th.this all happened on the date of 9/28/22.Anyways there is much more to this story and you guys can ask questions I might be able to answer some. I was hired onto a job in an assisted living facility with approximately 20 or so residents, it was a few times I’ve seen this thing but not as well as this one time.  As I said I’ve worked in this assisted living facility working 2p-10p, when night fell, they were simply the worst times for me. While working or walking the halls to make sure my residents were safe I felt watched, and not just watched by like my other coworker, or residents mind you the evening shift only had 2 staff members after 6 (ending dinner) until the next shift arrives. Well as I said I felt watched and it creeped me out, and it doesn’t help knowing that this facility sat basically surrounded by the woods, but this small town was haunted and known to be the most haunted in the US. To give you a hint on where, it’s also known for the “sally house”. Back to the story…. It was one evening in November. It was time after the residents cleared and headed off to bed so for mine and my coworker working with me as well this night meant downtime. We decided to go outside for some fresh air and just play on our phones. That’s when something told me to look and I turned my head and saw a tall man (doesn’t describe NONE of our residents) in all black facing us through one of the side door window facing the side porch where we were sitting. This man or thing had a top hat on covering half his face. I don’t know what I did or why I had to look away for a slight second but I did and when I looked again…… He was GONE!!!!!  ✨first time posting please be nice😂🙏🏽✨ I work at a daycare and have never once thought something weird was going on. Today was different, I came back from my break and the other teacher in my room told me that one of the kids was sleep walking which they have never ever done before which I thought was weird but we laughed it off. Throughout the rest of nap time (an hour) 5 different kids screamed in their sleep randomly which never happens and then one of the kids that sleeps the longest and sleeps like a rock sits up in their bed and was staring at the ceiling/wall wide eyes and smiling.the kid then puts their hands up like they want to be picked up and says something unfortunately we weren’t close enough to hear what they said. My coworker laid the kid back down and for five minutes the kid stared at the same spot still with wide eyes and smiling and then went back to sleep. I keep thinking about the kid putting their hands up and it’s freaking me tf out. Does anyone know what could have caused all of this? Can be anything relating to Paranormal A BIT FREAKY THIS!!

My husband does not believe in the paranormal and thinks it’s a bunch of nonsense.  At this point we were still early on in our relationship and living together for a couple of years. He bought an old 1929 house in a suburb near the big city we grew up close to.  I would often see the shadows move out of the corner of my eyes and began having a sense that our energy was not the only one there. Nothing too concerning.  We had a 120lb American black lab so it could easily be her moving through the house. Or we can explain it away that maybe the neighbors backed in and the lights just hit the windows just right.  One day, I tell my guy that I saw a small black shadow walk into the laundry room. I was not taken seriously.  Has to be some reasonable explanation. I mentioned it because it wasn’t a out of the corner of my eye experience this time.  The laundry room is in the finished basement. The only windows are glass block windows with a vent and they are etched/foggy. They are 4 x 3 blocks (I think) whatever the standard basement window size is.  This part of the basement the windows face into our backyard. There are no lights coming in from traffic. The houses were built in an old apple orchard so the back yards were long! About .50 an acre. About 1 acre between our house and the house ours backed up to.  We had an 8’ foot wooded fence along the property line. No outside light source.  A few weeks later we are getting ready to go to the store together. I was finishing some laundry and he is in the basement finishing up something on the computer that was down there, to the left of the laundry room door. He asks me to put the dog in her crate while he finishes up. He will just be a minute longer. The crate is in the basement but behind to the right of where my guy is sitting. The laundry room door is open.  All the lights are off now except for the hall light on top of the stairs and the pc. I’m now standing at the end of the stairs facing my guy and he is looking at the computer. Black shadow dog walks into the laundry room. My guy - I thought you put (dog) into her crate? Nah, thought you were going to. He calls the dog. I’m looking at our dog in her crate. Now he is losing his patience since there are things in the laundry room he doesn’t want her to eat or get into. Can you please get the dog? What dog? Fine, I’ll do it. At this point I ask him to turn around and look in the crate. Looks at the crate, looks back at the computer.  You saw it, didn’t you! You saw the black shadow go into the laundry room too! Only time he ever admitted that he saw something in that house.  Now I don’t know much about shadow beings.  Never really looked into it. We were in this house for 8 years and had our first kid here.  Never anything malicious or scary. [https://youtu.be/RzST5a938wg](https://youtu.be/RzST5a938wg)  please delete if not allowed ive begun a spooky channel branching in to all the occult please feel free to check it outSo I'm here to tell you about an experience I had with paranormal activity which took place back on 2006(summer)  So I was 18 years old and I was leaving with my brother in a building which had 2 apartments (2 floors).In the lower one there was us and on the second floor my cousins ,my uncle and my aunt.  Every summer my cousins ,aunt and uncle used to go on vocation at their home village so the house was completely empty for 3 months and no one was living there .  My aunt's bedroom was build right above our bedroom(brother and me)and 3-4 times a week when we were playing video games we used to hear *HEAVY* steps right above us(aunts bedroom).As said before there was no one leaving in the apartment and it was locked up for many days.Also there wasn't any buildings built next to this one so it couldn't be our neighbours .  We couldn't explain the situation so we decided to investigate it .We did some research and finally we bought a professional microphone which detects some specific frequencies (I don't fully remember the details)in order to detect something paranormal.  My father had a separate key of my aunt's apartment for emergency reason ,so we took it and opened the apartment ,set the microphone up and waited...  If a non paranormal sound(cars from outside,our voices etc) took place we did notes so theres not a misunderstanding.Also we were setting the microphone in the bedroom near 3 AM for 1 or 2 hours.  First night we heard nothing.Second night also nothing.Third night same story.But the fourth night we heard something that froze our blood.  I went into the room and said the following question : *What's your name ? I want an answer.* then left and sat with my brother and cousin in the living room .3 hours went by and when we checked the recording 10 minutes after my questions we heard *4* LOUD steps, a weird noise like the lips of someone who's very close to a microphone and then a CLEAR name...*Giota*(Greek name)  We freaked the hell out .We never thought we would catch something like that and we were terrified.After that we never did this again because we were pretty scared and also we read on a site that if you start talking to him you should end it right away cause it ain't no good.  4 months went by and we never told anyone or showed the recording about this incident untill our grandma RANDOMLY said about someone called Giota that used to live in this apartment.When we asked about her she told that this woman died at the age of 26 many years ago...   This incident still haunts me every goddamn night . I really don't believe in ghosts or stories that I read on the internet about them .But even now as a grown man ,I still wonder what happened that day .  Thank you for spending your time reading this incident of mine .The recording is in an old computer but if I find I'll be sharing it with you asap . So I myself am not sure if i believe or disbelieve the paranormal. I kind just open to both..   So I'm lookng for the opinion of people who do believe. Its about what going on with a friend.   My friend recently inherited a very old Victoriqn style home that has been in his family for over a century.  Sidenote: The part of the family he inherited from was estranged. His great grandfather ran off and cut off his family members in a attempt to distance himself from his family dark past.   The dark past involves the house itself.   The house was used by Adam's great great grandfather and mother as a "home" for mentally disturbed and or disabled children.  It basically acted as a place for family to dump there disabled kids kid they don't want to deal with.   Adam great great grandparents would do experiment on the kids both mental and physical believing they could cure the disorder or mental issue the kids had.   They had no training to do this what do ever.   And by experiments I mean they torture these kids. They starve them as punishment. They wouldn't allow them to sleep. Keeping them up for days. They used extreme physical punishment. As well as gave them a alot of unneeded and untested medications. And that just the start.   Mutiple kids die due to this and when this happen they buried the bodies in the backyard.    Once they were finally caught they had killed 5 kids. And had abuse so many more. A few kids that were found well technically alive were described as barley alive..   Adam inherited the house as well as a good amount of money. His originally planned was to use the money to fix up the house and sell it.  Dispite its age the house is in pretty good condition and if you had the money it could easily be fixed up.   The only issue is it is rumor to be haunted by the kids who die there as well as his great great grandfather. Who killed himself in the house before the police could arrested him.   Dipsite this sounded like the opening to a bad horror movie. It didn't bug Adam when he first found out as he wasn't a believer in the paranormal in the slightest in fact he poke fun at our friends who did believe it.   But after he tour the house for the first time.    He suddenly changed his mind and refuse to sell it. He had mutiple big time offers.  He use the money he got to buy a high tech security system. For the house and he refuse to allow anyone inside.   The security system was to keep out the paranormal fans who kept trying to get into the building.   In the past year he has own it he has been getting alot of requests from people who run paranormal investigations youtube channels to do a investigative in the house.   They have afford him a lot of money to let them in. He refuses no matter how much they offer.   But some refuse to take ni for answer and have tried sneak in. They all failed at the house is locked up right.   The other day he fianlly told use the plan for the house.   He is going get it tearing it down.  He using what's left of the money to destroy it. In 2 weeks the house will be gone. And the land donated to the town.   It is all being done legally. He went through all the channel to make sure he didn't step on toes.   Apparently the town themsleve are actually supportive of his decision. As the town council hate this house and the backstory. They believe the house has left a dark mark on there town.   I ask Adam why he was doing this and all he said was.   "It need to be destroyed"   I don't get it. Adam is really struggle financial. He still in school working toward a 9 year degree and still has 3 year left his student loan are piling up and his degree only allows him to work a part time job that pays very little. He really need this money why throw it all away.    He has had offer on this house. Big offer. I don't get why he is just destroying it.   Adam has also been acting weird lately before this he was always such a postive guy like the happiest nicest guy you met. But lately he been rather depressed and easily to anger.   So what your opinion on all this.   Do you think he is wrong for taken the house down.   Why has his personality change so much.  I confused and I need answer. I am worried about him. I’m not quite sure what’s going on in my home but feels potentially paranormal, based off past paranormal experiences I’ve had. But not in a scary way? So for my entire life I have slept with a fan because I am a light sleeper. I also can’t sleep in silence. I use it year round and now that it’s fall, I still turn my fan on high. I just face it towards my door instead of at my bed. About a month or so ago, I woke up and noticed my fan was moved across the room from where I had put it the night before. I was freaked out but brushed it off because my roommate was convincing me I must’ve moved it out of the way of the door the night before and just forgot to put it back. But I was fairly certain I did not. A few days later it happens again. Roommate is trying to convince me that I must be sleep walking.  It just feels off though. I’ve never slept walk in my life. I am well rested. And I usually wake up in the night, check the time and go back to bed. Groggy, but I always remember when I wake up. And I never get up. It started happening again, a few days in a row. I don’t feel scared but it possibly felt mischievous. Like something a little kid would do. In the past I have felt very dark things and this does not feel like that. The fan is being moved so far now, it’s not slight. Like it wants to be noticeable. Also it ends up being turned to face me. As a result I wake up freezing. If I slept walk I feel I would not choose to freeze myself to death and I’m the type of person who would go straight for the fridge. Also if I’m sleep walking why wouldn’t other things be moved? Why wouldn’t I leave the bedroom? Who sleepwalks for three seconds and goes back to sleep? Anyways, most recently it was my birthday this past weekend. My boyfriend was sleeping over and I told him hey let me know if I sleep walk (he doesn’t sleep much so he would probably be awake to notice). But nope, I didn’t (and never have) And the fan didn’t move the entire weekend he was there. So last night he had left my place and I go to sleep alone. I wake up to my fan moved all the way to the opening of my closet.  Any thoughts? Or advice? Because I feel I’m being gaslit by a fan lol everyone thinks I’m crazy and roommate is convinced I’m sleep walking. I’ve even take photos to show how far it’s moved.  Side note, it’s not the roommate doing it. Again, light sleeper and I lock my door sometimes. I would hear if she tried to come in. Also I’ve had my friends sleepover and share the bed with me but it doesn’t happen when they’re over. They also have never witnessed me sleepwalk in all these years.  And my intuition and body is telling me I don’t sleepwalk.   If it is paranormal I would just like to know what it means if anything. Is it just to annoy me? I even considered it like a “hello”. At this point when I wake up and notice it moved I just smile and put it back then go about my morning.I also posted this in r/paranormal.  One night as my girlfriend (now wife) laid in bed, we sensed something next to us. We normally lay on our sides but that night we were laying on our backs, faces towards the ceiling. Our eyes opened up and we turned our heads at the same time to the space next to her side of the bed. Whatever it was took off fast. It went from her side of the bed, right next to my wife, down the side of the bed, up over our feet area and out our closed bedroom door. What was really cool was the vertical window blinds adjacent to the bed where the spirit was swayed as the spirit went by them, kind of like if you ran your fingers on them from right to left. The energy was not only great enough for us to sense exactly where it was, but also great enough to cause physical movement of the vertical blinds. It happened so fast but we followed it with our heads and eyes as it moved out of our room, even though it was invisible, just pure energy.  I think about this occurrence a lot. It’s not the first paranormal experience for me or my close family, but it certainly was the most impactful.  After it exited the room my wife freaked the hell out and started to cry as she grabbed me for comfort. I was startled by what happened, but I never felt in danger or ill will from it. Whatever or whoever it was was just as startled from what I can tell. We haven’t experienced anything like it since. Hi I’m starting a podcast on YouTube and I am looking for any stories that I can talk about. Anyone who wouldn’t mind their story being posted can you send me them? Since I was very young I could see the future. As a dream before it happened or even guess it. I didn’t really pay attention to that until one day when I was about 10-11years old I heard a unfamiliar voice whispering my name. I was sitting on the couch and someone whispered in my ear even though nothing was behind me just the white wall. I panicked but I didn’t tell anyone. From that day till now I have experienced many things that I can’t give an explanation. For example, things moving by their own, the feeling of being watched, once my blanket flew on the air and it seemed like a person was inside it, I could see the shape.. then the blanket fell back to my bed. No one ever believed me, my friends made fun of me every time I tried to explain them we are not alone. I am writing this in case someone relates to me. I’m loosing it byeHi! My name is shy. I'm going to launch a YouTube channel soon (if you still watch YouTube) to post different reddit stories. I'm not saying soon, but maybe sometime in the future, will be animating some of your scary stories. I would really appreciate it if Ya'll could post on this so I can make the video and stuff without asking. I would love to read some of your spooky encounters! And... Happy Halloween!!!My grandparents house is haunted, strange stuff happens all the time that we have all got used to it over the years. I've seen people walking along the hallway, my mums seen legs walk up the stairs and my grandparents have both heard who they thought was me shout from the back of the house telling them I was home (I was about 7 hours away in my own home) and thats just a few of the things that have gone on so its quite an active house to live in. My sister is only 13 so she was doing what most kids her age are doing and was dancing around the kitchen yesterday evening making tiktok videos. The kitchen is down at the back of the house and has door with a window in leading into the utility room, at night the back room is normally dark so the only light would have been from the kitchen. She said she was twirling around when she saw a hand on the utility room side of the window looking like it was about to knock on the glass. Obviously this scared her enough to get my mum to investigate, she found nothing that would cause her to see what she did. Everyone was in the front end of the house watching tv so it wasnt a family member just playing a joke on her. It has happened before to me years ago except it was a full person stood behind the door and it was daylight. Also to make things more interesting her school bag that was on the kitchen side last night was found this morning in the middle of the floor with all of her books in a pile next to it. one night me and my friend were talking about weird core because we were just dorks back then. and she brings up how you can travel there, at first I thought it was a joke so asked her how she replied with at midnight wake up and look all over your house for a tall shadowy figure. And that night I told my mom what I was going to do, then she went I don't think you should do that, and because I was the child I was I asked why, and thats when my whole life changed forever. My mom said my grandma had an encounter with these paranormal beings and that they are real. Since then Iv'e been doing spontaneous research about them. So from when I was born to when I was 7 I lived in this house. From what I know, it wasn’t some weird old house but I’m not sure. My family is very much keen on drinking soda- even when I was younger. I used to drink so much soda that I would forget to drink water, so I’d get super thirsty in the night. I would go downstairs from my room and get water. When I went downstairs I remember this distinct whisper of names over and over again. If it wasn’t a whisper it was super loud wind which I doubt would be inside a house at 12-4 in the morning. I remember one of the names being Michael or something similar too it. My parents always told me it was my imagination which is fair because I was five or seven at the time. However I still remember it which is weird- anyone else experience something similar? Also for skeptics , I have a cousin named Michael so it could’ve been that I guess  (This is my first post and I’m on mobile apologies )In the early morning hours of April 15, 1987, my cousin Darrell Ward and friend Eugene Edwards were at my home in Vermilion, Ohio. We had shut off all the lights and we were going to tell ghost stories. Eugene got scared and said he didn't want to, but we convinced him otherwise and before the first ghost story was to be shared, my cousin asked me to look at the staircase at the far wall, that he was seeing a red laser dot on what looked like the 4th step area on that wall.  Sure enough, I could see it also. Eugene viewed it as well and petrified, demanded that the lights be turned on. Before I turned on the lights, I walked to the red laser dot and couldn't understand how it was there. When I turned the lights on, it disappeared, and Eugene is now running for the front door desperate to leave. My cousin and I grabbed him and calmed him down somewhat, explaining that the red laser dot must have came from some prankster outside one of the windows.  We next shut all the curtains and hung blankets over the curtain rods to make sure absolutely nothing could shine through. We then turned off the lights and sat down to wait and see if the red laser dot would reappear. After about 30 seconds, it did.  We were completely stunned, as it appeared in the same exact place on the wall by that 4th step. We stared at it now, just wondering what in the world was going on. A few seconds later, a 6 foot red laser beam shot out from that very wall, went across the room at a dramatic speed and disappeared at my cousin Darrell's head, who was sitting on a couch at the opposite wall, about 25 feet away.  The next thing we knew, there was something shadowy dark standing on the left of the 25 inch console television screen. For you younger folks, a tube type screen could still emit a very slight light even up to 5 minutes after shutting the TV off. This shadowy figure then runs up the stairs, 2 steps at a time and disappeared into the upstairs bathroom.  Yes, we were scared as hell, but we were also very curious. Kinda stupid, right? Next, we saw the red laser dot reappear, but this time it was floating in the air above the staircase. It would float for awhile and it was almost hypnotic to me. I snapped and said we should call Aunt Annie (Darrell's mom.) She told us 10 years earlier she had seen something like this right before Darrell's grandmother died (Aunt Annie's mother in law.)  Aunt Annie answered the phone and we were all excitedly explaining to her this phenomenon. She didn't act surprised, but couldn't explain it either. The red laser light was still floating. We hung up with Aunt Annie and soon after, different colored laser lights appeared and was floating around just like the red one. They were yellow, blue and green. Amazed, we started talking to these floating laser like dots, asking them where they were from and why they were here. There were no answers. They just kept floating around.  Soon I remember we all grew extremely drowsy and fell asleep while these dots were still in the air. It must have been around 2 AM. At 7 AM the phone rang and woke us. It was Aunt Annie, who called to say that Darrell's grandfather had just passed away. Hi, It's my first time posting, so please consider it even if it's awkward. I have often dreamed of ghosts since I was young. First of all, I do not mistake the person in the dream created by my unconscious mind and the ghost that invaded my dream for the same thing.  I had a ghost dream when I wasn't feeling well or tired. It's a little different from a normal dream, I can't see in front of my eyes. When I experience these intrusions, I have to estimate them only by hearing and touch. But it was the first time I've been dragged.  That day, I couldn't see and something grabbed my arms. I was asleep, so I felt dizzy and tired, so I didn't even care. Something grabbed me and pulled me down. I thought it would be a dream anyway, so I just let it go. (If you dream a lot of this kind of dream, you can realize that it is a dream.)  But something kept dragging me down. I realized for a moment that I shouldn't be dragged away like I was struck by lightning. I started resisting, trying to pull off what caught me. I felt like hands caught me. But I only know from its hands to its arms, and I don't know the whole form of something at all.  It didn't let me go. I was more seriously fed up with fear. I shouted "Let me go" in my dream. But I didn't even listen to it. I shouted it for the second time, but it didn't work. Maybe I was very desperate, but I opened my mouth in reality and shouted "Let me go" in a split voice that wasn't fully awake. Then it let me go.  After this happened, I told my friends that I was almost taken for a joke and didn't care. I wouldn't have posted this if it was over. That creepy hand just touched my shoulder when I was sleeping. Likewise, I couldn't see anything in front of me, and it suddenly touched my shoulder. As soon as it touched, I woke up with goosebumps.  As soon as I woke up, I looked at my right shoulder that it touched. There was a wall on my right. Shit I don't know why this is happening to me. What should I do to protect myself from this? And what the hell is this? Hello, for a background story I was watching Sam and Colby just for fun and I believe I have caught what seems to be a person in the background. This frightened me so I decided to take a screen recording of that part of the video. Now, while I sort of believe in ghosts my opinion might have changed based on this video. Now, I don't have all the evidence in the world to prove that this is a Spirit I would like to see what others think, so comment what you think. I will post the video on the next post. Just as I was awakening, in that foggy state between sleep and consciousness, I heard these words in my head:  Serve the Master, Serve the Master, Serve the Master, Serve the Master. Yes, four times.    I have experienced paranormal activity ever since I could remember. Because of this, I have never really been afraid of it. Actually, I have always been very interested in it.       One of the scariest experiences I have ever had happened over a long period of time. I was around the ages of 3-7. Every night around midnight my grandmother would fly up to my window that was on the third story, she would continuously knock on the window until I would eventually wake up and go over to her, and she would tell me to go to the woods.        Keep in mind my house was surrounded by thick woods all the way around. These woods always gave off a really sickening vibe. Side story but my parents would always send me out to play in the backyard by myself. I had such a bad feeling about the woods that I would always sneak back inside because I didn’t feel safe outside alone. One time my parents locked all the doors to get into the house because I kept sneaking inside after they sent me out. I stood in between the door and the frame of the door crying and begging them to let me in. I was a very adventurous kid, and I would do anything to explore, and I wasn’t afraid of being alone outside at anybody else’s house.         Anyways, She would often put some kind of odd explanation behind it, like “I am going to take you shopping if you get in my car, follow me to the woods!” somehow I knew it wasn't her, she just didn't give off the same energy as she normally did…However, I would still wake my parents up and ask them if I could go into the woods with my grandmother.       I know it wasn't a reoccurring dream because it would happen to not only my little sister, but my mother as well. It got to a point where my parents had to board up my window. So I wouldn’t eventually jump out of my window and die.       My “grandmother” wasn't the only thing that this creature would take the form of. Around the time that my parents boarded up my window, there a little girl with beautiful blue eyes, and wavy blonde hair, she would always skip into my room with her pink Victorian dress and white tights that appeared to glow, she would also tell me to go into the woods. Once again having a weird explanation behind it. The one I remember the clearest was “my nana has some toys for you to play with. But, she will only give them to you if you go into the woods.”       These experiences stopped as soon as I moved out of that house. Recently I heard about a creature known as a skin-walker It sounds very similar to this. however, I’m pretty sure a skin-walker  can only change into animals… so it’s still unclear. I still wonder what would have happened to me if I had I gone out into the woods. so i moved into my new apartment in early march and everything's going well but sometimes some creepy unexplainable things happen. the first thing was when my sister left her ihome there, i'm not sure about other models but her specifically needs to b plugged in and that morning it was going off, i got out of bed to turn it off when i realized it wasn't even plugged in, the numbers weren't showing or anything, i took it back to her right after that. there's also doors slamming, at first my roommate would swear it only happened when we close other doors but i showed him that none of the doors cause that, we went around trying all the different combos of doors and there was nothing.sometimes while i'm alone i will hear an iphone text tone, walking around, and some whispering, my dog freaks out at some of the noises and other times doesn't even notice them. and the most recent thing is the appliances turning on/off, i was hand washing my dishes (i always hand wash them because i'm really weird about how clean my dishes get; i haven't turned my dishwasher on once) and all of a sudden i feel a pool of water around my feet and the dishwasher is on and leaking water everywhere, i turned it off and noticed it was also really hot so i went to turn the ac down a little and it was off and at 78° (i usually keep it at 72°-75°), i called maintenance for the dishwasher and it was absolutely foul smelling water, my garbage disposal was all clean too so i'm not sure if backup was an issue but it's always a possibility, but basically that's all the stuff that's happened inside of my apartment, i have a lot more stories that've happened outside and in my past but yeah that's my ghost story(ies) i guess    When I was around the ages of 12-13, I would often be left home alone after school. My parents and my younger sisters normally didn’t arrive home for about a hour and a half. I normally didn’t mind being alone at all!  I could eat whatever I wanted, watch TV at a loud volume without being yelled at, and yell about how shitty my day was to my friends on FaceTime without being interrupted.        On that particular day I walked in the door, and dropped my bags. All I wanted to do was eat a fresh bowl of“Mac n cheese” and cry. I was exhausted. So I got to doing just that.         As soon as I began to boil the water I heard the unmistakable sound of somebody wearing big heavy snow boots walking around downstairs. I knew it couldn’t have been anybody in my family because my father (who was always the first one home besides me) wouldn’t be home for another hour. Even if he had gotten home early he would have messaged me, and I would have clearly heard the garage door open.       To stop myself from panicking I told myself that the washing machine was most likely uneven and I should go and check on it. I turned the stove off, and just in case somebody was breaking in I grabbed a giant kitchen knife and went down stairs. the washing machine, or the drier wasn’t even running. My brain basically froze… I stood in front of the stairway for a good minute trying to figure out what I had heard, trying to put some kind of calming explanation behind it. When all of a sudden the room went freezing cold, and I felt somebody standing behind me. When whoever this was breathed down my neck it was over. I full on sprinted up the stairs not only hearing footsteps behind me but also hearing heavy breathing. When I got to the top of the stairs I remembered I was holding a knife. I spun around to teach this motherfucker no to go into peoples houses, And when I did nobody was there.      I assumed that the intruder had retreated downstairs so I locked myself in the bathroom, and messaged my dad. He told me to stay put and to not make any loud sounds. When I asked him if I should call 911 he said no.      There I sat, In the bathroom. Trying not to cry, because my worst nightmare had finally came true. When all of a sudden I heard the sound of the heavy boots again. But this time they where walking up the stairs. I quickly messaged my dad to see if he was home and he said no. I felt my stomach drop as the footsteps came closer and closer, until they where right at the door. I covered my mouth with my hand, but that still didn’t cover the sound of my heavy breathing, due to sheer panic. I could see the shadow of this person’s feet in the crack underneath the door. I could hear him breathing on the door. I stood there, silencing my cries, tears rushing down my face. I was horrified. All of a sudden I heard my dad‘s garage door open. A Rush of relief filled my body. I heard the intruder run into my parents room.   My dad checked the entire house. There was nothing, no broken windows, all the door where locked, And of course there was no intruder. The only thing that was wrong. What’s the basement, It was trashed. When my mother had cleaned it that day. My dad joked about how it was just my imagination. He said that I was just paranoid. to this day, I still can’t explain it. I know what I heard. I know what I felt. Posted this before but got removed for formatting. About two nights ago i was with my girlfriend and her sister in their backyard smoking a few joints in my car. We smoke often so a few justs is really nothing. Around 8 pm her sister went inside. we live in new york, the bronx to be exact so the sun has been setting around 7pm and completely dark by 8pm. So now it was just me and my girl chillin im rolling up and we talking getting rowdy and then laughing nothing out of the ordinary.   In her back yard theres parking for about 4 cars but they were all out and on the i was parked closest to her neighbors fence on the right facing the road so i can see all the way down the driveway and directly behind me is mesh fence that you can clearly see through. Throught that fence is a church. Over on my right in her neighbors yard is a garden that you can see in. Im saying all this to let you know i had a great view of her entire yard from the front to the back and the sides so i couldve seen anyone or anything coming easily.   Well while we are talking out of nowhere we both hear a whistle.. about two seconds long,loud and clear. Immediately freaked us both out so much so she ended up from the passenger seat onto my lap but i was able to keep my composure and calm her down and get her to go back in her seat. This took about 3 mins and we were talking about it trying to find a logical explanation for what just happened. While we were doing this and basically calling anything paranormal not real and dismissing it as a cat or squirrel or even my car it happend again directly in my girlfriend’s ear loud and clear i even heard it coming from her ear area.   It was as if it was ensuring us it can hear Whistling out of nowhere us and disagrees. My radio was of ac on low as it was a little chilly and windows closed tight but it was as if the whistle was right next to her in the car. We stayed for another 20 mins and decided she was too uncomfortable to stay there. She says weird things always happen inher house i never really take it seriously and i let her know that i dont believe in stuff like that. This time though i experienced it and i looked and tried to think of everything to explain it but i cant which brings me here. Anyone know what this could mean or be. Im more scientific than religious so i just want a explanation but this is a tough one.  My girlfriends, her sister and brother did put me on to somethings they have experienced growing up in their house and i found it really interesting. 1. ﻿﻿﻿When they were little they used to play hide and seek and my girlfriend (22) would go hide in her sisters closet. Sometimes when she would go in there she would see a pale little girl hiding with her but she didnt get any bad vibes so she never bothered with her. I questioned this like i question everything and she said she was probably just to young to think much of it. 2. ﻿﻿﻿When they were kids my girlfriends brother said he once seen a little girl running down their hallway but thought it was one of his sisters friend but when he couldnt find her at the end of the hall he asked his sister and they both confirmed they didnt have anyone over. 3. ﻿﻿﻿About a month ago around 11pm my girlfriend was sitting in her living room and heard someone in the kitchen taking out stuff to make tea but when she went to go see who it was the stuff was just left on the stove as if someone left in a hurry. In the morning she asked everyone and GUESS WHAT?! Nobody was making tea. 4. ﻿﻿﻿A few years ago her moms brother committed suicide and they didnt find out until a few months after because of some family issues they were very close to him but his wife had some personal issues idk the full details. At one point he used to live there with them and when my girl's parents got divorced he took care of them like he was their own. 5. ﻿﻿﻿Before they bought the house when she was 2 a doctor lived there and the doctor had a daughter that was fine at one point and after a accident she became paralyzed. You can see this throughout with the door frames being bigger to accommodate a wheel chair and a ramp outside.The girl ended up dying in the house some years after her injury. Hello Everyone,  In the past I was quite the skeptic when it came to the paranormal. I wasn't one of those jerk skeptics, who would tell people to grow up or ridicule them. I enjoyed listening to ghost stories, some I thought were more believable than others. For instance, I found the ones where people saw, heard, and felt things more believable than stories in which people were badly hurt, killed, or property damage was done.  Still, as I enjoy the stories I always took them with a grain of salt. Though as I have had more strange experiences I took ghost stories more seriously than before, well not the super crazy ones. This will be a post on the list of experiences I had which lead to me being a believer.  The very first strange thing that I have ever experienced was when I was about 6 years old. I was at my babysitters house and one day I was walking down a hall and the door to the restroom was wide open. I looked inside and everything was fine, I went back to walking and then heard a noise. When I went back to the restroom I saw a drawer had opened so I ran back to the living room.  When I was 11 years old I had this constant feeling that there was someone in the apartment my family and I lived in. During the morning and afternoon I would be distracted with school work, family, friends, TV, etc. Though once night came, the distractions and noise dwindle, you are able to focus and notice things more. Whenever my family was home or I was alone, I always felt like there was this person in a white robe roaming the halls at night. One day, I was alone and the feeling got so bad I stayed outside on a cold November night for two hours until my family came back home. I don't know if it was my eyes playing tricks on me, but from the porch I was able to see into the window, I saw the curtains moving as if someone walked past them.  What is even more strange is that I got that feeling once more but instead of feeling as if it was someone in a robe, it felt like there was a man lurking around. It happened earlier this year, my grandpa had passed away and my family to Mexico for the funeral. I had to stay home due to being in college, I was all alone and in those two weeks they were away, I was paranoid. I would stay awake all night in the living room with all the lights on in the room. I constantly had this feeling that there was a man wandering from room to room, and I would think I heard doors creak open or close. In the morning when the noise of people filled the air, I would check the rooms and find nothing amiss.  Now this story is the reason I went from skeptic to believer. The rest I had thought was due to me being paranoid either because I was a kid or due to losing someone close. This one though, I had no explanation for. In 2020 I took a year off due to an error with my transfer to a school, I decided to work and got a chill job as a janitor. I enjoyed my time there, I had to clean four clinics with a three person crew, and each clinic was 30-40 minutes apart. The only problem was that the people I worked with at the time were not reliable. Two times I had to clean all four clinics on my own because multiple people did not show up for work.  My first strange experience in this job happened at clinic C, it was placed near a creepy alley and in a small town where the activity dies at night. While cleaning I constantly heard a dripping noise. I went to the sink I thought was making the noise and looked under it looking for a leak, nothing. I stayed a while to try and pin point where the sound was coming from, again nothing. I shrugged and went back to cleaning, and then when I left the room where the noise was coming from, it started again.  My final experience happened on a Thursday, a day before my last day there. It was at the biggest clinic, D, it had both clinical and dental services. There were a lot of stories on how the nurses would hear things. They said they could hear a lady scream, and one day I closed a door to a restroom and realized it made a loud shriek whenever you closed it. So I assumed that was the noise they kept hearing. Another day they said they would hear a loud clatter, one day there was a sliver tray for the doctor to put his tools on. One of the legs holding up the tray was flimsy and it would constantly fall, so I assumed that was the noise they heard.  As me and my coworkers were finishing up, one of them and I were waiting for the final coworker to finish mopping. We were in the large lobby it connected to the dental lobby as well, there's a glass door in the lobby that lets you see directly down a vertical hall to a horizontal hall that leads to patient rooms, a lab, and to the dental area. The floor was wet and most of the lights were off, my coworker asked me something and I looked at her and responded. Then I looked back at the hall and I seen a pair legs walk around past a wall, towards the lab or door to enter the dental area. I called for the mopping coworker, we all know not to walk on the wet floor but she may have forgotten and walked on it. Though she answered from behind me, she was finishing up mopping the entrance to the lobby. I then went out to the left of the lobby, down a dry hall which connected to the horizontal hall I saw the legs walking in. I looked down the hall and saw no footprints on the floor. The legs had sneakers like the nursers wear and black scrubs like they wear as well. I told my coworkers and they both said they heard nothing and saw nobody else in the large building.  I told my mom when I got home about what happened and she gave me her input. She said that since a lot of people go to the clinic, one of them may be carrying a spirit, good or bad. That spirit may have gotten attached to the place and stayed behind. She could see I was shook by this experience and tried to cheer me up ,it worked and I acted like I wasn't affected by it. But I was, and to this day I know what I saw. It was more than likely the one making the noises the nurses heard and it was real, I know it was. I am 16 years old and I have lived in the same neighborhood since I was around 6 or 7  it is a nice place, there isn't really problem with the neighbors and we all get along but where we live there is like 5 house three in a row and two across and behind the ones across it's and abandon place, there is two small buildings they both seem to be burned down and they have been like that even before we moved here... no one really lives there. There is like a wood fence ( I don't know what it's called) and it has holes on the bottom and for some reason no dog likes to cross over to the other side... and if they do, at night you can hear them barking as if asking for help and if they come back they most of the time aren't the same. Well when I was around 10 my moms friend lived on one of the houses that where across and she had kids around our age( my siblings and I) and we got along very well, one night we where on a trampoline it was my younger brother ( 8 at that time) My younger sister (6 at that time) one of my moms friend's  daughter(9 at the time) and I we where alone since out parents had gone out to a bar and had left us with my older sister and oldest daughter of my mom's friend they where both the same age (16) well we where tossing around a ball when one of us threw it too hard and it went to the other side, and since it was dark none of us dared to go get, but as kids we where like Oh i bet you won't ask "if there is anyone can we have the ball back" and eventually one of us did after a while of waiting we decided to just go inside when we where all at the staircase we hear a noise but the front light wasn't very bright and we didn't see anything until it got close to us we saw the ball... YES!! that same one that went to the other side, we had no idea of why at to do so we ran inside and decided not to tell anyone thinking they would make fun of us, well as the year went by non of us told anyone until I was around 12 and my cousin had moved in to one of the houses, ( my moms friend had moved ) we told our cousin and some of my brothers friends about that place and how we sometimes would see a shadow running around even though no one dared to go in there. Well at that time we also had new neighbors who had a kid around my age and became our friend. Their house was right in front of a big opening to the other side so one day we planned to go to the other side ... keep in mind it was our first time in there so had no idea on what to expect well at that time it was my cousin, My brother, My Brother's friends, my brother's friend's brother and  Our neighbor friend. My cousin and I where the only girls the rest where guys so they decided to go in first there was this building that was made out of cement bricks that was half destroyed and in pieces and the other half just seemed very old, there so many toys some in bags and some just there, behind it it was just empty, old grass and nothing else but what seemed to be toilet paper all over the dead plants. In front there was a small room also made of cement but this one had windows and was yellow, it was more of a small house with two rooms. one of the windows was broken but there was three, the other two where untouched. Everyone except me decided to go and explore deep inside the places and the houses, I decided to stay near the entrance to our neighborhood I was just walking around trying not to go in far, when  I suddenly notice something on the floor and I reach out to it, I was surprised by what it was, it was a picture of what seemed like a family there was a very pretty lady a little girl and a man , and in the background you could see this exact same place just not destroyed, the picture seemed very old and it was all folded with marks, I called over the guys and my cousin, and when they came I showed them the picture, we just stared at it for a while when we realized that in the back of the lady there was a figure like a man or a shadow and for some reason when I saw it I dropped the picture and till this day I don't remember very well but for some reason something tells me that I had dropped it because I felt it burn and something tells me that if that is true it may be because that was how the place got destroyed, as if I had been there but I'm not too sure but going back ... when I dropped the photo we heard a noise as of a glass had been shattered and of course there was only one place that had glass which was the yellow house, my brother and friend ran to it and screamed, our reaction was to go and check on them, when we got there we ran we ran without looking back we went to my house. Turns out that when we got there one of the two windows was broken and on the floor there was something written "GET OUT OF HERE" and it was written with what seemed blood. After that time we never dared to go back in, but even to this day we still see and hear things, like one time when it was dark my older brother and I where outside waiting for his girlfriend, there was no one home but us the rest where over at my aunts house, and suddenly we heard a scream so similar to my younger brother's voice coming from that place but at that time he was in Mexico ... Truth is ever since we decided to go in to that place, things felt very different now four years later I still wonder about this picture. and I know my story sound so unreal, sometimes when we talk about it , even we can't believe it .... but we where thereMy sister and I host a true crime podcast and every year for our Halloween episode we like to mix it up and do a spooky episode. This year we’re hoping to get a few true account ghost stories that we can read to each other and live react to. Please let me know if you have a story I can share and try to creep my sister out with!Hi everyone! I want to share one of my most hilarious and unexplained experiences with you all. And hopefully, hear from some people who have experienced similar things!  Almost 10 years ago, I was a college student in New Orleans. My roommate and I rented a small house Uptown. We had lived with each other since freshman year, and were so excited to finally move off-campus and rent our own place for our junior year.  The house was one long rectangle, with the front door in the center, my roommate's bedroom down a hallway to the left, and my bedroom down a hallway to the right. We had one bathroom, and it was next to my bedroom. I slept with my bedroom door open, and my roommate slept with her bedroom door closed. She went to bed at a responsible hour each night, and I was a night owl.  As school began and we settled into our routine, I began to hear my roommate engage in a bizarre nightly ritual: nearly every night, after she'd gone to bed, I would hear her footsteps down the hallway. I could hear her walk into the bathroom, leave the door open, stay in there for a minute or two, NOT flush, then walk all the way back to her room.  This always happened when either all the lights were off, or I had my door closed while I worked on homework, so I never saw her. I assumed that she was tiptoeing to the bathroom at night, using the toilet as quietly as she could, and waiting until the morning to flush so she wouldn't wake me up. She always woke up before me, so I figured, she must be... flushing... before she goes to class...? And I must... sleep through it? Sure!  For months, I regularly heard my roommate sneak into the bathroom. I never brought it up, (hey, it didn't bother me!) until one night when she had a friend over. The three of us ate dinner in the kitchen, which was in the center of the house between the two hallways. We were laughing and chatting about all the strange things roommates do that they don't bring up with each other. My roommate teased me for not soaking my dishes in the sink (I never knew!) and I got her back by saying, "Ok, but are we gonna talk about how you get up to use the bathroom EVERY night, and you DON'T flush?!"  My roommate looked at me like I was crazy. "WHAT are you talking about?!" she laughed.  I revealed her strange ritual in more detail. She wasn't getting out of this one!  My roommate was silent. She looked me dead in the eyes, said my name, then said, "I have NEVER gotten up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night."  We all looked at each other. I tried to laugh again. "So, do you sleepwalk?" I asked, mostly joking, because we'd lived with each other for over two years and no, she doesn't sleepwalk.  Then, I asked the obvious question: "Then WHO'S been using the bathroom every night?"  We named it the Bathroom Ghost. Even though the concept was pretty funny, we all felt genuinely weirded out for the rest of the evening. My roommate said she hadn't once heard any footsteps. Going to bed that night was hilariously terrifying, because when I did hear the footsteps that night, I KNEW it wasn't my roommate. From then on, I slept with my bedroom door closed!  As the weeks went by, we assimilated Bathroom Ghost into our lives. We joked about them, and I told all our friends. Mostly because my roommate demanded to be exonerated after I had been telling everyone that she uses the bathroom in the middle of the night without flushing.  \-- Chapter 2 -- (lol)  A month or so later, one late afternoon, I came home after class and flopped straight onto my bed. I had about 20 minutes before I needed to head out again, and just wanted to rest my eyes for a few. A couple minutes later, I heard my roommate walk down the hallway towards my room. I was totally pooped, so I kept my eyes closed, pretending to be asleep. (I'm sorry, roommate!) I could hear my roommate lean against my open doorway, and she stood there and stared at me for a few seconds. You know that very familiar human feeling of knowing someone close by is looking at you? It was that feeling. I kept my eyes closed, and after a few more seconds, I heard and felt my roommate turn around and walk back down the hallway towards her bedroom.  I lay there for about 15 minutes, awake. When I got back up, I walked to my roommate's bedroom to see what she wanted to talk to me about.  You can see where this is going. There was no one home.  I immediately called my roommate and demanded to know where she was.  "Um... I'm at work," she told me, very confused.  And, of course, she said she'd been there for hours!  \--- Chapter 3 ---  Things are getting weirder as the school year goes on. Bathroom Ghost still walks to the bathroom. The new joke is that Bathroom Ghost has a crush on me. My roommate continues to hear nothing. My childhood musical jewelry box with the little dancing ballerina on top starts twirling and playing the mechanical song in the middle of the night. THIS IS SO CLICHE I WOULDN'T MAKE THIS UP EVEN IF I WANTED TO, LOL.  I know this next part doesn't really count toward the official experience, but 1) I think it's funny and 2) it felt absolutely, 100% real to me, so maybe there's something to be said for that.  I start having dreams about Bathroom Ghost. I have an incredibly vivid, lucid dream that I am staring down the hallway at night, but the lights are on. I hear the footsteps, and this time, I'm brave enough to look at Bathroom Ghost. What I see absolutely defies reality: they are simultaneously invisible and morphing into many different forms at once, kind of like that crazy, trippy scene from A Scanner Darkly. I specifically remember for a split-second, it was a giant swan.  Now we get to the spooning.  It's late winter. My bedroom door is closed, the lights are off all through the house, and I'm lying in bed, waiting to fall asleep. (I SWEAR I was awake for this, but because I was waiting to fall asleep, I technically can't discount lucid dreaming or sleep paralysis. I should note that I hardly ever lucid dream or experience sleep paralysis, and all of these Bathroom Ghost dreams started coming on suddenly. Anyway.) I'm lying in bed on my side, facing the wall, and as usual I hear Bathroom Ghost's footsteps down the hall. Only this time, Bathroom Ghost doesn't stop at the bathroom. I hear - and feel - Bathroom Ghost walk through my door and into my bedroom. This is absolutely terrifying. I shut my eyes tight and I don't move. (At no point did I feel like I couldn't move or was paralyzed. I chose not to, like a squirrel freezing to avoid a predator!)  I feel Bathroom Ghost put their knee on my bed, compressing the mattress downward. My back is facing Bathroom Ghost. Inexplicably, I know that if I open my eyes, I wouldn't see them anyway. I know they are invisible. (I have absolutely no idea where I got this idea or why I was so sure of it!)  Bathroom Ghost climbs into bed with me. They wrap their arm around my side. I am little spoon.  I am so absolutely freaked out that I don't move a muscle. I just lie there, eyes shut, for what feels like forever. I lie there so long, eventually, I fall asleep. (How I could have fallen asleep while cuddling with a ghost is beyond me, and is the only part of this memory that makes me feel like I could have dreamt it.)  Of course, I tell everyone and their mother about this the next morning. Bathroom Ghost's crush on me is confirmed, and the guy I'm seeing says he's worried about the competition.  \--- Chapter 4 ---  Our story ends here. Bathroom Ghost continues to use the bathroom, but I am never spooned again and don't have any more crazy vivid dreams. When my mom helps me move out of the house after the school year ends, she thanks Bathroom Ghost for watching over me. I tell Bathroom Ghost that I'm flattered, but I'm moving down the street next year, and I don't think it'll work between us.  \--- Epilogue ---  My feelings about Bathroom Ghost:  I did always feel like Bathroom Ghost was nice. I never could tell if it felt masculine or feminine, but I certainly felt like it was tied to the house. Almost stuck in a kind of loop. I think Bathroom Ghost was happy that we were living there after the last renters, some frat dudes, had trashed the place. I also felt like they were lonely, and caring.  My concrete evidence:  The nightly footsteps down the hall, and the time Bathroom Ghost leaned in my doorway and stared at me, happened when I was 100% awake. I'll stand by that till the day I die!  My friends' explanations:  Everyone was so thoroughly convinced of Bathroom Ghost's existence by the end of the year that I didn't have to defend my story to anyone! New Orleans has NO shortage of weirdness and I was hardly the only student with a ghost story, lol.  My stance on the paranormal:  I'm an explainer by nature and love finding rational answers. I think paranormal experiences are just physics acting in ways science can't explain yet. I think people who strongly feel like they've experienced something inexplicable should be listened to. I think science is doing a huge disservice to itself by not collecting qualitative data on people's paranormal stories and looking for patterns.  THANKS FOR READING!

There was this one time, several years ago, my identical twin and I were about 11 or 12, and we had one of our first real creepy experiences together. I didn’t think much of it until today when we both talked about it because it was just so creepy to us.   We are almost 21 years old today.   So my twin and I were born and raised in a house built in the mid 1800’s and we actually still live there now. It used to be a mini hospital, and our garage actually used to be an old school house in the early 1900’s. It even still has the furnace in the classroom and teachers office and living area. Usually you would think a house built that long ago and with its history, it would be haunted.   But honestly we never really got that vibe from it. It felt constantly creepy, but nothing obviously paranormal happened until then. I think as kids, we wanted to think the house was haunted because it just felt like it should be. It has an upstairs, an extremely creepy unfinished basement with a root cellar, TONS of little cubbies and little doors leading to coraline-like crawlspaces. But despite that, it actually wasn’t too bad. We just loved to creep ourselves out.   Anyways, we were in the dining room, and if you can imagine it, right off of the dining room was the kitchen, and from the dining room into the kitchen, you can see the laundry room door  in the kitchen. And the laundry room door also led to the basement.   The door from the dining room into the kitchen was open, but the laundry room door was closed and we could see that from where we were sitting at the dining room table.   And at that moment we were drawing and doing homework and our parents weren’t home. I remember “human” by Christina Perri was playing  ( I still can’t listen to it to this day haha) from the living room tv. We hadn’t know until we talked about it just recently, but we had both been just kind of looking at the door a lot. We felt like we couldn’t keep our eyes off of it for too long. And this was strange because we’ve never really been scared of that door during the day (and this was during the day) and especially when it was closed, because then it wasn’t creepy. We were only scared of it at night.   But we had both been eyeballing the door but hadn’t said anything to each other or noticed the other one doing the same.  And I remember thinking “wouldn’t it be creepy if I looked up and the door was open?”   And I looked up, and the door was OPEN. That particular door makes a lot of noise when it opens too, and we heard absolutely nothing. But it was WIDE open.   My twin had also apparently looked up from his drawing and saw it too. We both didn’t even say anything or look at each other, didn’t skip a single beat and ran outside. I remember feeling this horrible terrifying feeling for the first time, like a tingling in my scalp and heart, all throughout my arms. It felt even scarier that it wasn’t just me, my twin saw it too. I was scared shitless. And we didn’t stop running until we were a little  ways down the road away from the house. We even left the front door open.   And what happened may seem kind of silly to someone else, but my twin and I have always had this really strange connection. We don’t have to even speak to each other and we just know what the other one is thinking and feeling. And that moment really felt significant because who gets scared of an opened door? I almost feel like it was some kind of sixth sense or it might just be that we both felt the same thing, whatever it was. And it seemed like every significantly creepy experience we had in that house was when we were both together.  I might add, no one opened the door, no one came home, and there was no wind. It wasn’t really possible in a house with no steady moving air.   I don’t know, I felt like this story was worth telling and maybe someone has a similar story or something to say about it. Hey everyone! Every year we like to do something a little different for our Podcast Halloween episode, and this year we’re looking for any spooky/paranormal/ghost stories that we can read to each other and live react to. Let me know if you have a story I can share and try to creep my sister out with!My dads house was built in 1929, because of this it has many walls and rooms and dark hallways and an intensely creepy stairwell to the basement.  The basement itself mostly gets good daylight from outside as there’s a window in each room though.  To start: all my life growing up I had heard from my siblings that the house was haunted, and my dad liked to tease that in the storage rooms connected to the stairwell there was an old woman that lived in them.  The stairwell to the basement has pale blue, cold concrete stairs, and a sharp corner that takes you from natural light to darkness as you make your way down.  In between the levels of the house there are two storage rooms directly across from each other with narrow short doors that are connected by the stairs.  They are pitch black and the doors don’t close.  The wood beams of the house and the rock is completely exposed, and the floor is uneven.  My oldest brother had once brought a ouija board into the house, and as soon as he did the kitchen cabinets started opening and slamming on their own.  I have heard once you accept a ouija board from someone you have to give it away to someone else if you want the spirits to leave.   I’m not sure whatever happened to the ouija board, but I know that all my life I never felt alone in that house.  I had never heard anything at first, just always felt like I was being watched.  I also would see strange reflections move across turned off TV screens when I was home alone.  When I got married my dad offered up the basement apartment to me and my husband.  It had just been remodeled and it was perfect for us just starting out.  Before the remodel my dad had used it for his fish tanks, storage, and just being by himself.  My husband and I’s first night in the basement things felt very off.  A heavy atmosphere filled the basement.  It was not a friendly presence.  It was angry, or malicious.  I asked my husband if he could bless the house, and he did so.  Immediately after the prayer the atmosphere was lifted.  But I still felt this strange energy, like whatever it was, was still trying to come in.  Like if we opened the door it would be back.  Fast forward 4-5 months and I am pregnant.  I often forgot to take my prenatal until late so we would be in bed with all the lights off when I’d go back into the kitchen to take it.  On this particular night I was in the kitchen, which was adjacent to the tiny living room with a window front door to a tight stairwell.  I could see into the stairwell where I stood.  There was a completely dark silhouette standing in the stairwell, looking right into my front door.  In that moment I felt that evil suffocating presence.  I felt like it wanted to hurt me and my unborn baby.  I reached down to my phone which had been on the table and shined my flashlight at the door, I didn’t see anything.  I wondered if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, so I turned off my flashlight and focused my eyes on the door again to see if it would still look like someone was standing there.  The silhouette was gone.  I returned to bed too scared to speak.  Shortly after this incident, I was still pregnant, I was waiting for my husband to get home.  The evening light cut through my windows in its familiar orangey yellow hue.  I was in my bedroom right next to the door, and that bedroom window was right by the stairwell.  You could always hear when someone was coming downstairs, and with the intense light shining up against the closed blinds, you’d see their legs walking down into the stairwell to the front door.  As I sat waiting (doing my makeup in front of the floor mirror, I’m not just a weirdo who sits on the floor waiting doing nothing lol) I saw the familiar shadow of someone coming downstairs, and heard heavy footsteps.  I thought it was my husband.  I peeked my head out the bedroom door which allowed me to see the windowed front door about 10 feet away.  Nobody was there in the stairwell.  I jumped to my feet and ran to the door and swung it open, convinced my husband had ducked down beneath the glass to prank me.  Nobody was there.  I went outside and started looking around desperately, running up the stairs to verify that nobody was pranking me.  Nobody would’ve had enough time to climb the six foot wall of the stairwell without me seeing and get out of my view.  From when I saw the steps coming down and when I was at the top of the stairs it was about 30 seconds.  My husband pulled into the driveway to see me standing at the top of the stairs confused.  I even asked him if he’d seen someone running away from the house and he said no.  After those two incidents I asked my husband to bless the stairwell down to the house, and I never saw anything there again.  The last incident is in the stairwell of the house.  I would often hear strange knocks on the walls that seemed to follow me as I went upstairs to do laundry, I chalked it up to a lifetime of being creeped out by those stairs and that the plaster walls and concrete stairs were creating noise from my noise.  One day I was in the kitchen cooking dinner and my brother was over.  We had a very nosy step mother, and she would knock on the door from the basement that connected to the inside stairwell and then just come in.  Because of her I put a bell on the door that would jingle from even a gentle knock.  So I heard a knock and the bell.  My brother and I paused our talking since we both heard it. I yelled come in twice but nobody came in, so I went to the door and opened it.  Nobody was there.   I asked my husband to bless that stairwell too after that.  It was the only thing that stopped the activity.  I don’t live there anymore, but my brother lives in that basement now and I like to tell him my experiences and give him the creeps! 😆 This is a short story, but a real one.   I was like 13 and I was sleeping in the living room one night because I felt sick and it was closer to the bathroom. Well I had fallen asleep, and I got woken up here and there by the sound of someone in the kitchen clanging dishes and running water and it sounded like they were washing them or maybe trying to make something to eat.   Well I had two older sisters who were known to make five course meals throughout the night so this didn’t phase me, I was actually comforted bc I was scared of being alone at night and I really liked my sisters.   I had fully woken up and the clanging continued, and I called into the kitchen “hey Ali” and as soon as I said it, the clanging stopped immediately.   I waited for a response, and no one answered. I immediately was kind of confused and a little disturbed. It wasn’t too scary yet because I knew what I heard and it wasn’t creepy.   So I just got up and walked to the kitchen, and I walked in and saw no dishes moved out of place and no one was there.   I slept with my sister upstairs that night after that Hi I'm going to resume the story so far. I will explain somehow the distribution of my house. Two floors, the second one is only rooms. 3 rooms. When you go upstairs and the ending right is room C, the second door by the right is room B, and room A in the left.   Okey if you sleep in room A you can see the stairs and the door of room C. One day my mom saw a men figure that looked at her and then went downstairs. She couldn't say anything at the moment but then she taught it was a boy that my sis or I sneaked. She goes to our rooms. I was in room B and my sis was in room C but we were sleeping. Later one day I was alone in the house, we had a dog, and he started barking at room C so I go there and see nothing. It was in daylight.   Then by this time because this thing does not have a pattern. My brother moved to room C which was empty since my sis moved out. He moved there with his wife and baby for a few months. One day they were chatting in the living room downstairs and listened to the monitor of the baby (just sound no image) that one of the toys turned on. The kind of toys that you move and lights and sounds turn on. So they go upstairs and see that the baby is still sleeping and the toy is not even near the baby.   Also, I need to clarify that a lot of people (I have 2 brothers and 1 sister) have been living there for a few weeks or months with their partners and kids. Is not a big house but we have a lot of space.  Till this moment I haven't really seen the thing. One day I was in the TV room, If you sit there you can see the beginning of the stairs and part of the kitchen. Is a house very open and with everything connected with no doors so the first floor is a big thing with few separations. Okey, so I was there watching tv and then I see someone coming down the stairs and going into the kitchen. I waited to see the lights of the kitchen turned on or see someone crossing the kitchen. But no one was there. This is the first time I saw it with my own eyes.   At this time I had this boyfriend coming over. He was helping me cook something and I was in the tv room choosing something to watch and He says "I saw you!" and I was like not in the kitchen so I go there and I asked what he was talking about. So he explained to me that he saw someone walking behind him exactly in the path that I saw this thing walking. Is the same every time. End of the stairs walks down and then to the kitchen.   Later a cousin of my sister-in-law was visiting the city so she came over, and REFUSED to sleep in the house because she stated that there was something there.   These stories took place from 2005-2015.   But again in 2020-2021 when covid was in the strongest phase. My dad got sick, and by this time at the house, only my parents, myself, and my daughter lived there. Since he was really sick attached to oxygen. My mom and he slept in the tv room. One night both of them saw this thing, this figure walking the same path I saw before.  This ghost, spirit, thing, has never hurt us. But it doesn't have a pattern. But it looks like the Hatman, and is shadow-like. Ill make my encounter quick & humors. The other day my friend told me "Hey something weird happen here, can you come and stay the day? alone? while I'm at work far away?" I said yes I have nothing better to do, So I packed my bag and off I went. All morning passed nothing so far, I worked out a bit so showered next. Im in the shower & the bedroom door opens and slams shut twice. I know it was closed because I made sure of it myself as I sat in the living room earlier waiting. I said "Hey sis your back early give me a second and ill be out." No response I changed and walked out, nothing but to find the bedroom door open. I said out loud "ohh hey satan you've come to play? little slammed doors wont scare me away" Ill use a simple technique :? turn off the lights, close the curtains, light a candle and say "come out and play?" :) I went around the house saying things like "u like the dark I'm in ur cave" "ohhh show yourself and blow me away"...funny thing I arrived at the bathroom inside I stared to choke away... my GOD little satan, very cruel jokes. it seems he wants to play bend me over or put me on my knees? maybe he wants me dead as I laughed and touched my throat with my left hand with my right shaking I reached in my pocket for Holy Water and I also sprayed away"...he let go and ran away...now time to cook and make a meal I feel so much energy to rid this house of bad ju ju sh!t...hmm this home is now mine so satan shu shu away. (when performing a cleaning of a home expect the unexpected so be ready and dont run away)Hello my name is Riley I’m 35 years old. I’ve always had the ability to see things ever since I was a child and so has my mom and grandmother.  I lived in rural Connecticut and I liked to go exploring in the woods around my parents property. One day when I was about 15 I discovered an abandoned house. It was a old Victorian style home and I went in and started exploring the house. It looked like a time capsule inside the house it was very cool to me. I was standing in the main entrance looking up the stairs when I saw her. A woman that was standing at the top of the stairs. She was pale and she was wearing a long white dress. She had long black hair and green eyes. I said hello to her and she smiled, waved and said hello back to me. I asked her for her name and she said Melody then she disappeared. I was in shock and went home. I went back the next day and was looking around the outside of the house and I felt like something was telling me to go to the back of the house. I did and that’s when I found it a grave with the name Melody on it according to the grave she was born in 1810 and died in 1836. After that I went home and I picked some of my mom’s roses and went back to the house to and went back to the grave. I put the roses on the grave and then I got the urge to look up. I looked up at the upstairs window of the home and there she was standing in the window staring at me. She smiled and waved at me then disappeared. Tell me what you guys think. Hi there. I need some advice on a situation. Basically I feel watched even though I’m all alone. This is a feeling I’ve had for many years now. I’ll explain what happened. When I was younger maybe 13 or 14, I made a homemade ouija board and played with it at our past apartment that we used to live in. I was home alone at the time and I said things that I shouldn’t of have said. I I said out loud that I invite any spirits, entities or demons to come forward.  Looking back I don’t think I even said goodbye. I sat there and the shot glass that I used never moved. I got up and threw it out. It was around this exact time that the feeling of being watched came over me. We moved and the feeling followed me. That’s when things began to happen. My stuff would disappear then reappear, cold spots/breezes, lights flickering, strange dreams. A lot of unexplainable occurrences would happen. Once our bread loaf and a few kitchen utensils got thrown. No one else was in the kitchen. Ever since I messed with the ouija board, this feeling of being watched never left me. At some point the strange occurrences stopped but the feeling didn’t. There were a few times where my mom mentioned seeing shadow like figures in our apartment. She said she saw something go towards our room one night. I share a room with both of my brothers. She made sure to pray afterwards. My younger brother not that long ago came running into our room saying he had seen a dark shadow out in our hallway even though no one else was upstairs. I’ve never seen anything myself except for in my dreams. Now these are just dreams and could mean nothing but I just thought that I would add them in. In the first dream, something that I couldn’t see came up to me. It felt freezing cold. It leaned and kissed me. In the second dream I saw myself sleeping and right next to me was a black figure watching me as I slept. In the last dream, I saw a black floating mist. This thing came up to me and told me how much it loved me. I said the same thing to it. It’s voice was deep too. I woke up confused. As of now, the feeling still lingers and I don’t know what to make of it. I grew up getting used to the feeling though recently it’s gotten stronger. At the point I don’t know what to do. I just want closure as to what’s going on. Do I perhaps have an attachment? Or am I just insane? I was peacfully asleep, dreaming of fluffy kittens and flying with ravens when I felt something flick my nose. This was strange beacause I always sleep with the blanket pulled up over my head. The blanket wasn’t moved which was odd, but I brushed it off as a weird dream. As I was about to close my eyes, the blood  in my ears roared so loud I could barley hear anything else and my heartbeat was unnaturally fast and just as loud as the roaring. My skin felt like it was made of nebula and my head swam as I sensed something standing in front of me. Adrenaline & fear flew through my system like a riderless skateboard flying down a steep ramp but I didn’t move. I didn’t scream. I didn’t breathe. I couldn’t. Even thinking was like swimming through thick syrup. It was as if I had been hit by a train of… something I can only describe as pure energy.  As it slowly dawned on me that I may not live to see another day, I heard my mother’s voice calling me. Somthing told me told me it wasn’t her, it didn’t have any warmth to it and it was weird for her to call me before she knew I was awake. So I stayed still and silent, the blood still roaring and my heart going so fast I thought it might explode. I heard the being shift and step on a crinkly candy wrapper. Then I sensed it slowly reach out a limb as if it were going to grab my foot. it must’ve decided against it, because I’m still here, writing this. But it kept its arm outstretched, its stature frozen completely, as if it were mimicking my unmoving state.    By now the roaring had stopped, but I still sensed the being there, so I didn’t move.  I slowly reached for the pocketknife I had clipped to my pants. Thank goodness I had forgotten to unclip it and put it away, because although is was small, it was very, very sharp. I flipped it open and slowly reached for the end of my blanket. I ripped it off and slashed the air with the ferocity of a tiger. There was nothing there. My boyfriend and I last weekend decided to take a trip to the Elms Hotel, overall the trip was fun the hotel is supposed to be pretty haunted and we got some cool things from the hotel.   This is our first week back and things have been so weird. The first weird thing that happened was Tuesday there was a huge crash so my boyfriend immediately got up thinking someone broke in. Obviously by this reddit that was not the case there was no evidence that anything had even fallen.   On wednesday the Alexa when off just whispering I had the tv so I could hear what she was saying but I turned it off immediately.  Now Thursday is when things started getting weird. It was the middle of the day and my boyfriend and I were sitting in the living room, no tv we weren’t even talking to each other just watching tik toks. Then the Alexa starts rapping some weird ass Mark Twain rap which is apparently an easter egg. Yet no one has said anything.   Which brings us to tonight, we keep hearing tapping outside the weird and of course nothing was out there, after i said “this is so annoying” The loudest bang hit our bedroom wall. The little tapping just continues, hopefully it’ll end soon.When I was a kid, I lived in a haunted house   I'll preface this by saying I'm generally a very rational person and am a skeptic by nature. I didn't grow up in a family that was religious or into the supernatural, and if I hadn't experienced these things myself there's no doubt in my mind that I wouldn't believe in it today.  Our house was built in 1912. On the outside it seemed like a totally normal house. The moment I stepped inside that house I felt uneasy and couldn't explain why.   My sister and I shared a room upstairs. I was sitting on my bed in my room one day, facing the doorway. It was one of those accordion doors that would click closed and there was a space of about 2 feet at the bottom where it didn't reach the floor. It was only my mom and I home at the time and she was downstairs. I heard the floor creak outside my door in the hallway as though someone was walking into my room. Then I saw a white mist type figure pass by my door. At first I thought it was my mom bringing laundry upstairs and I waited for her feet to appear under the door but they didn't. I went and peeked under my door to see who was in the hallway and there was nobody there. There was no wind and no way it could have been a curtain blowing. I definitely saw something pass by my door.   Another day I was in my room alone again. My family was downstairs in the kitchen at the time. There was a wardrobe by the door that had a lamp on top if it. I was just sitting on my bed again and all of a sudden the lamp started to violently rock back and forth. It scared the shit out of me so I immediately ran downstairs and my family could see I was scared and asked me what was wrong. I told them what happened and they all looked at each other. I discovered later they tried to protect me from knowing any of the paranormal experiences that happened there.   Another day my sister and I were in the living room. It was summer and we had one of those window air conditioners in the kitchen window. My dad was just finishing building a detached garage outside and had turned the breaker off so that he could finish wiring the electrical to the garage. There was no electricity at all in the house. We were just sitting there and all of a sudden we hear the air conditioner turn on. My sister and I looked at each other and ran outside. My parents asked us what was wrong and we told them how the air conditioner turned on by itself. My dad said that's impossible, there's no electricity going to the house. We had no explanation for how it turned on.   Another day I was in my room and we had one of those big fans that sat on the floor. My sister would always yell at me for leaving it on when I wasn't in the room. On this day, it was really hot so I purposely left the fan on. I went downstairs to have a shower, only my mom and sister were home at the time. I came back up to my room and the fan was switched off. I immediately felt uneasy because I knew I had left it on. I asked my mom and sister if they had gone upstairs while I was in the shower but they hadn't. No explanation for how it turned off.   This was back in the days where we would record songs off the radio on cassette tapes. One day I guess I forgot to press stop while recording and had left the room. When I listened back it sounded like a man and woman arguing on the tape but couldn't quite make out what they were saying. There was no-one in the room at the time.   When I would go to sleep at night and the lights were out I would see what I now know were probably orbs, but at the time I had no idea what it was. It was like static electricity in the air. I don't know how to explain it. The closest thing I've ever seen to it are sparklers. It used to scare the shit out of me and I would run to my mom's room to tell her and she would say oh it's just your eyes playing tricks on you, don't pay attention to it. I would go back to bed and hide my head under the covers.   There was a spirit that would stand in the corner of my room and watch us constantly. After we moved out I told my mom one day that our new house felt so much happier than our old one. She asked me what I meant. I told her how our old house had such a heavy atmosphere and felt totally different and I always felt like I was being watched. I asked her if it was haunted and she finally admitted to me that it had been and they had tried to protect me from it because I was the youngest. I described two of the ghosts to her; the female that was always in the corner of my room and the male spirit that stayed in my brother's room. I described the time period they were from and how they were dressed. That the woman was in a long dark dress and the man sat on the floor in my brother's room and looked out the window. No idea how I knew these things and turned out I was pretty close, except for the woman wore a black veil that hid her face and the man actually had no legs, which is why I thought he was sitting all the time.   While we lived there I had a recurring dream where I saw a little girl in a white nightgown cowering in the hallway outside my bedroom and crying because the house was on fire. I was constantly paranoid about fires while living in that house and would constantly check the electrical outlets throughout the house to be sure everything was OK. After we moved I worked at our local library and there were tons of resources about the history of the town. Turns out before our old house was built at that location, there was a hotel that used to stand there in the late 1800s that had burned to the ground, killing several people.   My dad was the only one who didn't have experiences while we lived there. My mom had the most experiences and I think at first he started to think she was losing her mind. It wasn't until my siblings and I started to tell him about our experiences, and specifically me with the lamp incident in my room, that he started to think something was wrong with the house.  My brother worked late nights and would get home around midnight. He would walk through the dark house to get to his room and would often hear someone calling his name. He thought it was our mom and would go in her room to see what she wanted only to find her asleep. Eventually he would rarely sleep there. He would sleep at his friends or girlfriend's houses instead.   My sister and I shared a room. We had the female ghost dressed in black veil who would stand and watch us in the corner of our room. One night my sister woke up to find someone sitting beside her on her bed holding her hand. She thought it was me and asked what I was doing. No answer. She looked over at my bed, I was there, sound asleep. She looked back and the figure was gone. To this day she sleeps with her head under the covers and her arms tucked under her.   My mom had multiple experiences. I'm not even aware of all of them and honestly don't want to know. I know she said there were at least 5 spirits in the house, plus others that would pass through. In our basement we had an old cold room and this apparently is where the spirit portal was located in our house. Not sure why it was there or how it got there, but I think previous residents had dabbled in things they shouldn't have. As I said previously there was a hotel that had burned down at that location, killing several people. I think previous residents could sense the presence of these spirits and dabbled with ouija boards or seances to contact the spirits and ended up inviting in dark entities. Just a theory, but I believe people who lived there before us made the situation worse.   My mom is very sensitive to spirits and had experiences with all of them I think. The woman in black was a protective spirit and would communicate with my mom quite a bit. I believe that spirit protected me from the other spirits also.   My mom was walking down to the basement one day and she lost her footing and started to fall. She suddenly felt hands on her chest and pushed her back to an upright position. She never saw anyone, just felt them catch her as she fell.   Another day she was vacuuming in my brother's room, when the phone rang. She ran downstairs to answer it and while she was downstairs she heard the vacuum start up and being pushed across the floor. She ran back upstairs but by the time she got there it had stopped. She was the only one home at the time.   We had so many issues with "phantom calls" in that house. This is before cell phones so we only had a land line. The phone would ring constantly and nobody would be on the line. Or we would hear static or as though there was a muffled voice on the line but we couldn't make out what they were saying. I don't know how many times we had the phone company come to check it out only to find nothing wrong.   Then it escalated. My dad would get up to leave for work in the middle of the night and just after he would leave we would get a call where the person would say "I saw ____ leave for work". This freaked my mom right out so the police became involved, to try and trace where these calls were coming from. We had to keep track of the time the calls came in, what was said (if anything), etc. They never were able to trace the calls.   We moved shortly after and had the same phone number. The calls stopped as soon as we moved out and we never had issues again.   Before we moved my mom was really worried they would follow us. The woman in black was very religious and my mom had an old Bible beside her bed. One morning she woke up to find the Bible open beside her on the night stand and these words highlighted: "And this house will be my home forever."  Thankfully they didn't follow us. I'm very sensitive to spirits and have had other experiences throughout my life but that will be for another day. I hated that house and was so happy to move. I'm grateful for the experience though because now I know our spirits do continue on after death, just in a different way.  Edit: spelling and grammatical errors When I was around that age of eight or nine my grandmother invited my sister, and I to have a sleepover at her house. To summarize the day it was like any other time with at my grandparents. We went shopping, played soccer in the backyard, drew on the patio with chalk, and overall we had a very good time! When the day finally came to an end and I had to go to sleep, I didn’t even think twice about it. I was exhausted after a long day of playing with my grandmother and my sister. I slept in my uncles old room down the hall, while my sister slept on the couch in the living room. All was normal until i felt somebody in the room. I have always been able to pick up on people’s energy’s and tell if someone is in the room with me. I thought that my sister had had a nightmare and was going to talk to me about it. So, I rolled over to make contact with her. But what I saw wasn’t my sister. It was a very tall man who was staring at me. His arms where crossed and overall his body poster was very angry and upset. At first I thought it was my grandfather but I realized Almost immediately afterwards that the man in my doorframe was much taller than my grandfather. I got out of bed and walked over to this figure to find out that this absolutely wasn’t my grandpa. This man’s face was completely different. The way this man glared at me scared me so much I ran right through him screaming and crying to my grandmother.   Flash foreword a few years later when I was around the age of 12. My grandmother went through a whole box of vintage pictures explaining who they where when she got to one photo in particular, immediately the young man in the photo caused me to have a flashback to that sleepover. When I asked who it was she started crying and said it was her dad, and that he had died very young. We moved to current house a few years ago right before the pandemic started. since then, we’ve had strange experiences. Starting with my youngest daughter getting upset with her older sister that she came into her bedroom, and tried to freaked her out by walking around her room and got under her bunk bed. Oldest daughter denied the allegation and we kinda settled with younger one had just had a dream. Then, some month past. She saw a girl standing in the living room after midnight when she was getting water. She was freaked out and she started to sleep with her older sister. We still were thinking that it’s just another vivid dream or mind tricking. But after another several months later, when my daughters were playing hide and seek and I was just sitting in the dining room while observing what they are doing, I saw a girl coming after my oldest daughter while she was looking for her younger sister from basement. I thought it’s my younger daughter and when older one asked me if I know where her sister went, I pretended like I have no idea even though she was behind her. After a few minutes, my younger daughter came out from a recycle bin chest which was big enough for her to get in, and she had my husband’s help to hide in there. Then I was like “what the hell?” I saw a girl behind my older daughter and I even remember how pretty her hair was. Then I noticed that I wasn’t even wearing glasses. It’s impossible for me to see details of hair shines also the way the girl came from down stairs made no sense unless her head is very very long or entire body was floating. Oldest daughter hasn’t seen anything but we’ve had similar violent knocks on the door experiences. All while my husband had no experience. So we just kept dismissing it’s just misunderstanding and some mind tricks. Up until recently. We’ve captured unknown voice in a video and be recorded while changing my son’s diaper. It was too clear and we couldn’t deny it anymore. We got night vision home security camera to see if there’s any activities we can capture. The first night, we captured a lot of “dust” or “bugs”. I’m not a huge believer of “orbs” but there were some strange dusts and bugs I admit. And then, voice again. I’ve uploaded them on my YouTube channel to see if there’s anyone who can identify them. We were planning to try to capture as much as possible… but seems like all activities were only for the first night. We haven’t recorded voices or weird orbs since the first night. Now I wonder if there is a way to communicate with them other than using a ouija board or a ghost box. So I have always wondered why this happened to me so I decided to post this to see if anyone has had the same thing happen.   So one night I was playing video games and it was about 3-4 am and my brother was kicking me out of his room so he can sleep. Anyway me being a kid I was just getting angry and hot and me saying no to get off the game or whatever. Anyway it begins to escalate and we start yelling at each other. I’ve never felt that much hate in myself it was such a strange sensation and then suddenly my door just bursts open with such force we were both scared. Especially me since I just started crying instantly. My brother went to go check and there was nothing there. I ended up sleeping with my brother that night cause I was so scared. But at the end of the day my brother introduced me to Eric Andre that day so it wasn’t too bad ig haha. But yeah that’s it. So this one of the more tamed stories.   I don't think my house is haunted but I do believe I am haunted or I pick up spirits.  So last weekend my mom and brother came to visit me for the weekend, they had just walked through the door and I was getting them settled in, so one of my roommates had left on a business trip and the other moved out the week before, so I offered the extra room to my brother.  My mom and I were walking past the stairs which leads to three rooms up stairs, including mine, I called for my brother, not towards the stairs but down the hallway  "hey, you can take *former roommates*  room" we thought he was in the kitchen or lounge which was further down the hallway but we got answer from upstairs which caused my mom and I to look up the stairs because we were at the base of it.  My brothers voice "yea, I know" my mother and I laughted at how eager my brother to have his own room to sleep in instead of a couch in the hallway.  We moved towards the kitchen which was attached to the lounge only to my brother standing in the middle of the lounge, my mom and I looked at each other confused:  My mom "we hear your voice coming from the upstairs bedroom"   My brother looked at us and struggled because this is a norm in our family. My father was German and my mother was French. All that matters is that I grew up watching ghost shows with my father. At one point he looked me in the eyes and said « when I die, I’ll haunt the shit outta you to prove I’m real » He didSo for context, the town I used to live in has frequently been referred to as "the most haunted town in Australia" and I used to work in a bar on the towns main street, with parts of the building being over 100 years old.  This bar, according to the stories had 3 ghosts that lived in it, mostly in the old upstairs area that was no longer used as a public space and just as storage.  None of these ghosts where at all malicious but staff staying back late to close, such as myself would frequently have sightings/encounters.  That being said the only time I was ever remotely unsettled by am encounter was with that of a young boy who, according to the stories, had died in a fire.  In this upstairs storage area was an old photograph of this boy, and to put it simply, he moves in the photo. Now he never moves while someone is watching but you would look at the photo, look away for a second and when you look back the boy would be in a completely different position.  I saw this happen on several occasions and the only reason I know it wasn't a trick or just me going crazy is due to several of the bars staff (both past and present) have confirmed seeing the same thing.  I dont think it's anything bad, just a little boy playing around, but it used to weird me the hell out. It sounds cheesy as hell and was probably just a dream, but when I was 11 I woke up in the middle of the night on Halloween to a man's voice in my ear saying - very clearly - "You were there." Like RIGHT next to my ear. It scared the sh\*\* out of me and I had to sleep on my parent's floor that night. Never happened again, but other creepy things did in that house. Like one time, I fell asleep staring at my closet, but I didn't realize it because I was still seeing the room exactly as it was before I fell asleep (almost like an out of body experience) only now there was the shadow of a boy dancing in my closet. My dad was a "ghost hunter" at the time. He never found anything but I was always afraid that ghosts would follow him home. It made me super paranoid lol. True ghost/ paranormal stories wanted…also permission to use as content to use in my new YouTube channel that we are currently setting up. Any stories will be greatly appreciated. Thank you In advance. In a rural downtown known in its locale as "the gateway to the lakes region", change has long been accepted inevitably. My wife's cousin, Adam (rest his soul), and his friends were renting one of the last homes remaining on the main street. The house was a old colonial with a pole barn one-cart garage attached to the rear.  I had spent some party time in the pole barn noting the obviousness that the only remaining items from some previous owners was a wall hung photo of a toddler boy and a couple toddler toys. They were able to rent for a short time before the house was sold for commercial property. It would soon be time to leave. One peculiar afternoon, after arriving to pick up Adam, I waited in the pole barn for him to be ready. It contained a punching bag where I could get my blood flowing a bit.  Only a few punches were landed before I noticed the child's photo and frame broken immensely at the base of the bare frame wall where it once hung. Intrigued, I walked over to get a closer look then back to the bag trying to think nothing of it .. as the hair on the back of my neck peaked and heart rate rose on high alert. In my mind I wavered between thinking myself fearful and that I was not alone in the pole barn. Trying to ease myself back into the bag, I could not focus and immediately walked out. While walking swiftly back towards the main house I felt a poke on the back of my hand. Shocked, I lifted my hand to sight a drop of blood escaping from the web between my thumb and index finger. My head swirled with riled reason and reality. (The back of my hand, how did I do that, did I do that?) In the main house I met Adam and asked what happened to the photo. He explained that he and his friends got "freaked out" by it one night and proceeded to smash it to relieve their anxiety. I was somewhat amused, but more disturbed by their choice. When we left, I left concerned for my lack bravery and the little boy whose home would soon be torn down. It was less than a couple weeks later, in dream state, I was unexpectedly and drastically pulled into what my wife called a  wormhole". It was quick movement through a 'tunnel', it was 'windy', it was 'loud' and I was now staring into the pole barn from above. I didn't see the boy, but knew he was there.. I suppose my instincts kicked in and the only thing I could think to do was to tell the boy that he needed to leave. It felt like I was yelling above the noise and I made every word or gesture I could think of that would make the message clear. It was not long at all  before I was pulled back out of the pole barn feeling strangely like I had accomplished my purpose. So, I don't know if what happened was real and I never experimented with lucid dreaming, but I like to think that I helped the spirit of that boy move on.so to start out this woman in the white dress is the first i’ve ever seen of a ghost, it happened when i just moved to a new house for the first time pretty young and i noticed something weird in my room that i would have incredibly vivid nightmares. it felt like i was actually in them and i would wake up in sweats so i stopped sleeping in there. ever since that happened my mom told me that my sister knows about ghost and just that there’s an old lady here that used to be in my room so me being me i didn’t really care i started switching between living room and my moms room until one night when my mom was going to bed around this time i felt off and when i tried going to sleep i started to uncontrollably cough my mom being worried kept asking me if i needed water but i said no until i looked at the open door then i saw her  her hair was down and pale and her eyes were practically piercing you  i could see her white nightgown and everything and she just looked angry  ever since then i sleep with my doors shut and after a while the coughing stopped and we moved until i decided to talk to my sister about it but not in detail just about the lady and she goes “oh yeah i used to see her walking around the house outside with a bun” i was confused because i never saw her like that but still to this day whoever that was im terrified of her So my friend was taking selfie’s in her car and in one of her selfies there was like this sun beam blur but it looked just like a face. It looked just like the side of my face, I’ve asked my friends and my mom and they say it looks like me. Im really afraid and it could honestly be anything or even just really a sun beam blur, but it’s really freaking me out. Any suggestions? Hey everyone! I’ve come here before with a similar issue.. well kinda, our situation has progressed from the last time i shared. In short me and my household have experienced some paranormal things, hearing voices, watching things move on their own, things disappearing. worse of it all  the youngest baby (2yrs) started waking up around 3 screaming as if he was terrified. Since all of that i had done a simple cleansing on our house n i put a protective crystal above the babies door. Everything was fine.. no weird anythings happening. A few days ago my sister went to check on my youngest nephew, just as a gut feeling she had in the middle of the night. She slightly opened the door to peak in and she sees my nephew sitting up right completely under his comforter, she continues in the room to lay him back down, she looks at the other side of the bed to see my nephew on top of the blankets knocked out, he’s obviously been sleeping.. she then grabs & moves the comforter that STILL looks like there is a kid under it to find nothinggg… recently I’ve just had feelings of someone watching me and I’m sure something is I’m just not sure what they want?? Any input ? Or questions you have let’s discuss below!!! Saw a ghost, reasonable explanation would be that I imagined it.  Back in a summer camp, 10 years younger, had the larger cabin/house with 3 other guys since we were the oldest of the group. Before nighttime, ended up having all the other guys come by to play Fifa and just chill out. Being someone who has constantly slept 3-4 hours my whole life, I was the last one to stay awake.  While everyone else had either stayed in the bedroom or left, two other guys stayed in the living room where they ended up sleeping while I watched antenna tv on a old, large armchair. At around 2am that night, I had begun to flip through the free antenna channels, finally finding a sort of comedy tv channel where a stand up comedian was performing. The screen was glitching too much to make out the comedian, but it was the only thing on that wasn’t bible or paid programming related.  I took a look away from the tv in front of me to my right, for no reason other than being bored, and saw it.  It was a man, with an unkempt beard, mustache, worn farming clothes, and a distinct hat, imagine  some sort of Fidel castro style military cap. He was both in front of the bedroom door and behind the kitchen counter, facing me. I could not see him from the waist down due to the kitchen counter, but the rest of the man, I could.  Maybe I’m lazy, but after all these years, and after telling my story to friends and family, I still don’t know the exact word to describe his, I don’t know, physical form? His body was both see-through, hazily distorting the doors shape behind him. He was physically there. Not as a sort of mist, but physically there, while also being just transparent enough to see-through. His eyes had no pupils, only a grayed white void, but It felt like he was focused on me.  Now what did I do? I stared at him, frozen with fear and dread. 30 seconds pass and suddenly the man makes a subtle angry smirk, and I acted in that exact moment. Out of fear, I lifted the oversized armchair from under my feet, and quickly moved 6-8 feet forward, armchair and all, and sat directly in front of the tv.  Eyes wide open, I was ready to be the very least chased by the man I had just retreated from. All I heard was the televisions bad audio and nothing else. In front of me, the tv’s picture was still showing a “comedy tv” logo, and bad picture quality stand up. I stayed frozen, watching the television and not daring look behind the armchair, even as the curtains began to light up from the morning sunrise. I finally heard my teacher knock on the door and call with his distinct Turkish accent to wake up. That was enough for the two guys that were in that same living room to wake up and ask if I had woken up before them. I finally got up, walked to the kitchen, and then told them what had happened. More of the guys began coming out of the bedroom, either leaving or staying behind to listen to my story. By the end of the camp, everyone of my classmates had heard about what had happened, and even more stayed the following night in the “ghost cabin”.  I have never seen anything like it since, but I can 100% guarantee that I saw what I saw that night. Unless my mind imagined it at that moment of course.  The camp was in rural Texas, I just got in the rental van and arrived. I have not been able to find the camp on Google, but distinctly remember a basketball court directly behind our cabin, with a >50ft drop directly to its side that led to a rocky, dry riverbed. Other than that and the cabins layout, I haven’t been able to locate the camp after repeated attempts.  Sorry for the long post for something that I witnessed for only a minute, but this is the first time I take the time to post my story anywhere. Stayed at this B&B that was a farmhouse. Was dreaming about some random witch I heard about that was a local story in the area and then suddenly woke up. It was about 2am when there was knocking at the bedroom door, we had the section to ourselves so knew no one was there.  The bedroom door knob started to turn and the door opened gently, we had locked the door before we went to bed. There was no one there. Couldn't sleep after that and had all the lights on.Hello my name is Alexa I’m 28 years old. I’m a medium and have been my entire life I get it from my grandmother. When it comes to seeing spirits I’m the most gifted in the family even more then my grandmother I see and hear ghosts as clearly as a regular person. When I was about 8 my grandmother died and we had to go to the funeral home. I lived in a large city with my parents and I still live in the same city so the funeral home we went to was large. When I walked in it was like walking into a crowded stadium for me there were so many ghosts of all ages that it was overwhelming. I knew immediately that they knew that they knew that I could see them being a medium is like being a giant beacon. Some just started at me, some smiled and waved at me, some said things like hi little girl and how are you. One ghost took a particular and I really liked her. She was a young woman no older then about 26 I was leaning up against the wall while my parents were in the funeral director’s office doing paperwork. I was outside the office setting on a bench just watching all the ghosts that were there. The young woman approached me she looked like a biker girl I’m assuming a motorcycle accident is what killed her she had on a pair of jeans, a T-shirt with a black leather jacket and a pair of tennis shoes. She was pale and had long black hair and blue eyes. She sat down beside me and asked what I was doing there and I told her then she put her hand on my leg and said she was sorry. She sat with me and we talked for about a hour while my parents were in the office. She told me her name was Sarah and she asked me about my interests. When another ghost would try to interrupt us she would tell them to go away she seemed like she was a very strong woman. When my parents came out of the office she disappeared. When my parents and I were leaving the funeral home I turned around and she was standing at the door. She smiled and waved at me then disappeared again. A few years ago, I was staying at my grandparent's hotel they run but my grandad had died not long before I went to the hotel. Anyway, I was sat at a table next to a wall and my uncle took a photo of me. When he looked at the photo, he saw a white hand next to my face so took another incase it was something on the camera but there was nothing there. I still have the photo but can't find it. I believe it could've been my grandad there.Paranormal/Supernatural Activity! Searching for YOUR footage/audio/evidence of paranormal/supernatural activity. Comment with leads.

This Really Happened ok so I just thought some of u might find this cool but it was freaky for me in 2019 I got a toy in aus we have a story called the magic pudding and it was my first book as a child after getting the toy I started to see thing more. I had always seen things but it was like spirits and stuff that didn’t want to harm me or anyone but after getting it things got dark I was see some really scary figures. they felt like they wanted to hurt me and I was scared. they got closer over time at the start of 2020 in Feb they were so close and I could feel they wanted me dead and others around to be hurt. I thought it was all in my head as I’m disabled and have mental health problems. I ended up crying on my phone with my doctor as the state got shut down and started talking to people and dr about it being mental health as get got worst. I was unable to leave the house by the end of 2020 without my brother or sister with me. I didn’t talk about it and everyone dr I talk to said it wasn’t mental health. for Christmas, I was made to go see family and after a week I had the worst anitxy attack I had ever had that lasted 3 weeks. I could leave my room, I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t move or eat. no one had any idea what was going on with me and no one could help. after my anxiety lifted up so I could do things but I couldn’t leave the house. Some things had happened in the month of 2020 that made it seem like something else I had nightmares that would make the hardest core of horror and gore fans scream. a dream that I call what death itself would be as a room and saw things that seemed like they were out of a horror film it was so scary. but I didn’t want to say it was a demon or something. but at the start of 2021 something throws my cat off my bed and she hit my closet door, she wouldn’t come back in for weeks. I was mad and started to think back to when this all started and the only thing I could think of was the toy. I picked it up off the shelf and felt sick. I passed it to my mum and she took it, she almost gave it back right away. that was it. my dad throws it out and now it’s gone. just thought this would be a good place to tell this. a doll for the 1970 magic pudding did so much damaged to me   The nightmares so I wanted to write down sep of the nightmares so I walked into a room it was a red light on, gut, death was everywhere I cant say more i just cant find the words. it felt so so so real like it happenedI recently posted about the haunted house I lived in when I was a kid. After moving from that house I realized I'm able to sense spirits around me. These are a few that have happened over the years. I don't really consider myself to be psychic or clairvoyant but maybe I am, I'm not sure.   I don't typically "see" spirits in the traditional sense. I have seen a couple physically in front of me, but the vast majority I see in my mind. I get a mental image of them and I also can often sense their emotions at the time. Sometimes they try to communicate, but it's all telepathically.   When I was in university, I was trying to find a class. The building I was in was old and the room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor. I went up the stairs and as I walked towards one room in particular I suddenly could see in my mind a soldier. He had short dark hair and was dressed in an old fashioned green uniform. He had a bayonet in his hand and was charging me. He was very upset I was there and was yelling at me. It scared the shit out of me. I turned and ran back down the stairs and ran out of the building. Months later I had to go in the building again (downstairs only, there was no way I was going back up there!). I noticed a plaque imbedded in the wall that said the building was dedicated to the soldiers who died in WW1.   I had a part time job at a conference centre. Part of the building was an old house, and there was a story that it was haunted by a man. All I knew at the time is that some employees who worked the front desk had reported seeing him over the years. One day I was near the area where he had been seen before and I had a mental image of the man. He was older, maybe in his 50s, and was dressed in what looked like old work clothes. He was balding and missing teeth. He reached into his pocket and showed me a pocket watch and smiled, as though he was amused. In my mind it's like a camera zooming in and it zoomed in on the pocket watch. Then he put it back in his pocket and turned and walked away. After this I was curious about the ghost story there and I looked into the man who supposedly haunts it. Turns out he was accused of stealing a pocket watch and was hanged at the gallows that at the time of his death had been located across the street.   At one point I was looking for a new place to live. There was an ad for a small bachelor apartment located near a friend of mine in an old house. When I went to look at the place I could feel the spirit from the street. I still went in to take a look at the place but I knew even before I walked in the door that I couldn't live there. The spirit there was a very stern Victorian woman. She was in a purple dress and she really didn't like me. She stood in the room the entire time looking at me disapprovingly while I was there looking at the place. The ad was for a sublet and the woman who lived there currently was acting a bit weird, like she was desperate to get out of that place. I don't think the spirit liked her either lol. The spirit seemed like maybe she had ran a boarding house or something at one point and was very picky about who she allowed to live there. There was no way I would ever live there.   This is getting long so I'll leave the other stories for next time!  Edit: spelling and context I have come here in search of YOUR true supernatural stories! Whether it’s ghosts, poltergeists, creatures, ufo’s. I want to hear your stories. Why?

Thanks! this demon attached himself to meThrough A Ouija board And it's like HE now follows me for life Haven't had any problems in a year or soBut now all I sudden I'm waking up with scratch marks on my arm And I'm smelling a rotten egg smell And I can feel him watching me And hear him at times Taunting meHas anybody else had this problem Please respond if so I've previously shared two other "ghost" stories here, and well... There's really only a few more strange/unexplained things I can think of. The next of which being "Little Jimmy."  From 2008-2013 my uncle owned a bakery where I worked during my college years. (Sadly it closed when he died unexpectedly.) The building itself was a very old one, and was basically just a long rectangle shape. We divided it up into 3 rooms, and added the actual bakery part onto the back. The first room, where you walked in obviously, was the store front, with a door to the right that lead into our "cake decorating room." It's what it sounds like. A room where we would decorate cakes, store things, and just use as a general "back" room. Continuing through that room was the second back area with freezers, and the storage closet, and a mini office room divided off from it. Continuing from there through the original back door, was the bakery.  Anyway, that building had actually been a lot of things in it's life. It was multiple bars, a hair salon at one point, and it was even a brothel. This was a place where some pretty famous gangsters also passed through back in the day, so even it's basement had hidden rooms from the times of prohibition. But, this is all just back story for what the building itself is/was... As for what happened to us working there... It was just a lot of strange things.  The first thing I can ever remember happening was the cupcake holder flying across the room. We kept it on a shelf on the right side of the cake decorating room (by the door), and one day we heard a loud CRASH that scared the heck out of us. Me and my coworker went back there to see what fell/broke, and to our surprise we found the cupcake holder all the way across the room by the other door laying on it's side. We didn't think much of it though, as this was before we even would suspect a "ghost" or whatever.  The second event occurred maybe a year or so later, and happened in the middle of the night while my uncle and the other staff were baking. One of our coworkers turned around to see what appeared to be a little boy with an old looking hat on. It freaked her out, but apparently she was a part of some ghost hunting team and said she was "used" to this sort of thing. That night I remember me and my parents went over there as well, but of course we didn't see anything.   After this, things started getting a little more weird/annoying. Things would randomly go missing and show up in other places. We'd hear loud footsteps in the back as someone headed to the front. But rather than opening the door and walking into the store front, they would stop at the door and no one would be there when we opened it to look. Same thing would happen a lot in the back room as well, where you'd hear someone's boots climbing up the ramp from the bakery, but vanish at the top of the ramp.   Eventually my uncle started calling "it" Little Jimmy, and whenever something weird would happen, we would just blame it on him. Strange things like this continued for years, up until we had to close down. Now the place has been reopened as yet another bar, and I can't help but wonder if they experience the same things we did. Hi im Penelope my friend is emma and she tells me about all of her demons that are violent and nice like her lil sister Nina who i cant see but for all i know is that she is nice. she has three dolls that here grandmother made when she was my age or younger, Emma told me how they died: doll 1, has raincoat braids red balloon, no one liked her so she killed everyone then killed herself, doll 2, blue dress, didnt survive during Titanic, doll 3, pink dress ,murdered.  doll 1 has been the creepiest of them all, last month, her balloon was missing and that night she heard a balloon POP and when her dad went in the kitchen, cabnites were open and pots and pans were on the floor, this remaines the mystery for all of us. My childhood (1970's) home was on a street that dead-ended into a cemetery. Where the street ended, two 10-foot stone columns marked the beginning of the cemetery. A streetlight about 5 yards before the columns lit them up come dark.  When I was 10 years old, I was allowed to play outside in the neighborhood until 9pm, or about dark in the summertime. One early fall evening, it was about 8:30, it was getting dark early, but I was determined to stay out until 9'oclock. A friend of mine lived in the last house before the cemetery began. I went there and knocked on the door, asking the mom who answered if my friend could come out. She agreed, and said 'Wait a minute, I'll get her."  I sat down on the front steps to wait for my friend and looked toward the cemetery columns. I saw a man standing there on the cemetery side, kind of shadowy as the streetlight had not come on quite yet. But I could see him well enough. He had on green Dickie pants and shirt, the kind workers wore. And he was smoking a cigarette. I thought he might be from the neighborhood. I literally blinked and then he vanished. At the same time the streetlight blinked on. The man was GONE. I could see far enough in all directions to know he couldn't have walked away in any direction.  I was so spooked I jumped up and ran home, not waiting for my friend. We are looking to get some SPOOKY true ghost stories for Halloween! Please let us know if you have tales to share! [https://www.tiktok.com/@ericorlazorid/video/7157040987846626606?is\_copy\_url=1&is\_from\_webapp=v1](https://www.tiktok.com/@ericorlazorid/video/7157040987846626606?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1)  For my graduation party, rather than having anything typical, my friends and I rented the nearby haunted house known as “Whispers Estate” for a nightly investigation. I wasn’t really expecting to have too much activity and I was kind of right, besides one instance. When the caretaker told us that we were free to explore, I immediately began filming with my GoPro Hero 7. I recorded for the first 7 minutes of the exploration and ended the recording when I was able to record the video of this ball moving so that I would easily be able to find the footage. I recorded for the rest of the night but oddly didn’t seem to capture anything else. I think that the movement of this ball is easily the most unexplainable thing I’ve ever seen because I can rule out all ways that this could be fake. From the angle that the ball moved, it’s literally impossible for somebody to have thrown the ball or for there to be strings attached. My sister and her boyfriend were at the staircase when it happened, but they didn’t notice it and I don’t see any way that either of them could have made the ball bounce like that. Anyone who’s been to Whispers Estate would also know that there isn’t any ventilation that would be able to move the ball.When I was 6 or 7, I was spending the night at my grandparents house. It was probably about 11 o'clock at night and I had woke up needing to use the restroom. I was climbing out of bed when I saw a man standing in my doorway. I couldn't see his face because he was in the shadows but I just thought it was my grandfather. A second later, he was gone. So I went to the restroom, got back in bed, and forgot about it. Years later, I was telling my mom this story. She told me she had seen the same thing when she was little except one detail was different. When I saw it, my door was open. When my mom had saw it, it walked through her closed door and through her closet door. This freaked me out even more because I sleep in her old bedroom. Whenever I go out to my grandparents house, I sleep in the same room but it still freaks me out to this day. Hey everyone! So basically I want to start a YouTube channel where I posted Reddit stories and I thought the perfect first video should be halloween themed. I was wondering if anyone could help me out and share their true halloween stories or experiences they may have had or even link an old post if that makes it easier for you. I’d really appreciate it. I understand permission is needed in order to post peoples stories and I know many people don’t ask for permission and I don’t want to do that. When I was little I would say about 3-5 years old I would talk to a little girl according to my mum and gran my uncle used to talk to this girl toon. Recently I went back to my grans and saw the same little girl standing in my grans window, she was beside two tall figures and the pulled her away I haven’t seen her since. Last year in summer the school janitors caught that same girl sitting on my seat …… Tonight me and my friend decided we wanted to do a ouija board because we were bored. We had done it in the past and it worked so we went into the woods in my neighborhood to try it out. It wasn't working well, it only answered our first question of "is anyone here" with a yes but it stopped moving after that. but it felt kind of as if the spirit was trying to communicate outside of the board? at first it was just the sound of footsteps and rustling circling around us but we were able to dismiss that because we were outside and it could have been an animal. we decided to give it a shot though and asked for a sign, and a car alarm went off and my flashlight stopped working. that was weird but not completely confirming. we asked for it to make another alarm go off, and a police siren went off, very very close to us. we then decided to ask it to make another alarm go off while we were walking back to my house. before we left though, we decided to ask for one more, very very definite sign that a spirit is present. immediately after asking we heard so many police sirens passing then blood curling screams from a woman from what sounded pretty close. it wasn't playful screams, they were very intense screams of either pain or fear. several of them. like it literally sounded like someone was getting murdered. after hearing this we ran out of the woods and as we were walking back to my house, we heard another alarm go off. I don't know if this was coincidental or if there was a spirit contacting us. the energy was horrible and extremely negative while we were trying to contact something. if it is a spirit, it definitely is not a good one. Im going to be checking the news a lot the next few days to see if someone was a actually murdered because it really sounded like it, especially with the amount of cop cars we heard rushing that direction. Hello!  I am looking to collect heartfelt or scary ghost stories from long-term care staff.  Specifically, I  have a wild hunch there is a link  between the concept of place  attachment from gerontology and the  potential mediating effects of  dementia on physical and social  insideness.  The farther along someone  is on their dementia journey, the  less likely they are to stick around  the LTC home after death, as their  memories of "home" are tied to  places earlier in life.  It absolutely  is fringe gerontology, and I  think it would make for a chilling and  sometimes heartwarming podcast or story collection.  I  worked on  an extended care unit in a 100+ year old hospital and there  were  abundant stories of the creepy founding nuns walking the halls on  the  acute care floors, but not much on our unit with a lot of cognitive   impairment and recent renovations.  Please DM for the link to the story submission form if you have something you want to share! This happened to my dad, not me. Around 2 years before I was born my dad was taking the nightshift at a school. He was a custodian. He went around the school checking if anything was off and cleaning. After he was done doing his job, he went to exit the school. Before he left, he went to close and lock the doors inside one of the hallways. He did so and right when he turned around, all the doors had slammed shut at once. He was terrified and closed and locked them as fast as possible, he ran out and got out of there. #  Truly Scary Storie  We cannot tell you what kind of a story this is. We simply cannot present it as we present other stories. It is too tremendous for that. We are very glad—and proud—to share it with you.When I was in university, I lived in an older house that was built beside a church. The house was over 100 years old but unsure of actual age. I lived in the basement and had a few housemates. We didn't know at the time it was built on a cemetery. That was discovered shortly after I moved out.   Weird things would happen in the house but am still not sure if it was haunted or just purely coincidental. I would hear footsteps above my room late at night and when I would ask the next day who was in the kitchen at 2am, my housemates would say they never came downstairs at all. My one housemate had a cat and the one day we were in the kitchen, the back door opened by itself and the cat walked in.   I did see what I believe was a shadow figure in that house. I had a bookshelf beside my bed and had a Buddha statue on one of the top shelves. In the middle of the night there was a huge bang and when I woke up I saw a black figure jump from the bookshelf to the floor and run out of the room. The shelf with the Buddha figure had fallen off the bookshelf and the Buddha had smashed to pieces on the floor. I thought at first maybe it was my housemates cat that had somehow knocked the shelf off, but the next morning when I told my housemate what had happened they said the cat had been locked in their room with them all night.   Shortly after that I moved out. The house was owned by the church and there was a parking lot in the backyard. The church was adding an addition and had started construction and digging up the parking lot behind the house. During the construction human remains were found which obviously halted the construction until it was determined why the remains were there. It was found that before the house existed, a small cemetery had been on that land. At least 30 skeletons were found and not sure if they were able to determine the identities or why they were buried there. For some reason when the house was built it was decided to build on top of the cemetery and the records of the cemetery's existence was either lost or forgotten over time.   Not sure if other housemates had experiences there. It was a creepy house and I remember them mentioning hearing things at night and not liking to stay there alone. Unsure if it was haunted but weird things definitely did happen there. When I was about 7-8 years old, I remember going to sleep over a kids house, I will call him Richard thought this was so long ago I may be forgetting what his real name is.  Their parents were friends with my parents, so we weren't close friends, but I was very happy about it.  He had what may have been the coolest thing for a kid in the 80s to ever see:   **A Pac-man arcade cabinet in his basement**.  Now to help understand this story, you need to understand the layout of the house.  This was a raised-ranch.  You walked in the front door looking at a small set of stairs that lead down to a finished basement area and a similar set of stairs right next to it going up to the main floor.  You could see the kitchen from the landing as you entered the house and to the right was the living room.  The left side of the main floor was a hallway to the three bedrooms and the bathroom.  One was Richards where I would be sleeping with another of his friends I will call him Michael (I do not remember what his real name was).    But the basement was what I was focused on.   Because as you went down to the basement family room, there was a hallway that has a small room to the left where the arcade cabinet was.  It was a small room covered with brown wood paneling, like all basements in the 80s had.  The front door of the coin receptacle was left open so you did not need quarters.  You would just flick the little metal pin to mimic a quarter and play.  This is where I wanted to go.  But it was time for bed.  Now going into Richard's room it was covered in WWE (WWF at the time) wrestling posters and toys.  I was not as into them as the two of them were (I had Nintendo) but played with them like kids do.  We ended up staying up very late, much too late, because the parents just let up do whatever (as was also common in the 80s) and it was great.  This was also my first real sleepover where we had run of the house.  Considering we were three boys not being watch, we were not doing anything dangerous.  Play wrestling, watching TV in his room, and going to the kitchen for junk.  However we were not playing Pac-man...yet I thought.  At some point I am sitting in Richard's room by myself, the two of them left for some reason.  I felt a little uncomfortable for whatever silly reason.  They were gone a long time.  Self conscious over the fact I was not close friends with either of them, I asked myself 'what were they doing without me?  Let me check'.  I leave the room walking towards the basement, thinking that must be it.  Even if they were not there, I would get to play so win/win.    I walk down the stairs to the basement where it was dark, but bright enough to see.  It may have been a full moon or there were outside lights, because I did not need to turn on any lights.  I saw the room and saw the hallway where the arcade awaits, but then *Richard* walked out and stood in front of me.  He did not say anything and he was in his underwear.  This was very uncomfortable because he looked mad, like he did not want me to go down here.  I stood on the bottom step not moving for a while.  None of us saying anything.  Finally I figured 'ok you do not want me down here' and went back upstairs to go to bed.  Looked up the second stairs towards the kitchen is where the chill crawled up my spine.  Richard and Michael WERE in the kitchen, getting something to eat and were up there the whole time.    Now Richard was an only child and there was no one else in the house other than his mother and father.  There rooms were across the hall from his.  There was no other way from the basement to the kitchen other than maybe from outside.  They could not have walked past me without me knowing, and there was not enough time to put cloths back on and get back into the kitchen if they were just pranking me.  They also did not say anything about what I saw, because I said nothing.  Thinking if they were pranking me, they would have mentioned it.  I went into the kitchen and ate some food and went right to bed.  Again, if this was a joke, a 7-8 year old boy would have said something.  Did not say a word to anyone about the kid in the basement.  To this day I have no explanation for this. Hello !  I come today to tell you my story, which has been going on for a few weeks now. My friends advised me to post on Reddit to maybe make sense of all those events.  To give a bit of context, I'm 29F married to 26M with a 3 years old baby girl, living with 3 animals (2 dogs & 1 cat). We rent a house in a somewhat strange neighborhood in Belgium (Gilly), there are many abandoned buildings in our street, including one right in front of my house where  homeless people were staying and where young people came to do urban exploration, but the building caught fire and is now boarded up. My house isn't very old and we've been living in it for 4 years now, it's a two-sided house that's not very well insulated, so I always hear my neighbors' children running down the stairs or making noise against the walls.  All that to say that I'm rather Cartesian person, I believe in esotericism but I always try to find a logical answer before thinking of more spiritual ones. What's been happening to me for the past few weeks can't find any logical reason, that's what scares me.  First thing happening is: blood drop coming from nowhere. We were in the garden with my husband, when we decided to entering the house, we discovered 5 drops of blood on the ground. 5 perfectly round drops with no other trace. Of course we directly thought of our animals, we examined them from every angle, not a drop of blood visible (we also examined ourselves). Panicked, I send my husband to check that nothing has happened to our daughter who was sleeping peacefully upstairs and also ask him to check all the rooms in the house. We also compared the blood drops with the red food products we had (grenadine, raspberry vinegar) but nothing looked like the stains we found. So we went to bed pretty scared that night.  Second thing happening: appliances that turn on by themselves. One night at 3am our printer turns on by itself and starts printing sheets (nothing abnormal on it, just the amount of ink left in the printer) for no reason. I first thought that the cat could have accidentally turned it on by passing over it. While trying to reproduce the scene, I realized that it didn't work, the printer is bluetooth and only activates when we launch it from our phone. You must log in before you can print. This incident doesn't necessarily scare me, I think it's more of a network problem or something like that. What bothers me is that it happened again, at the same time a few days later with my record player.  Last thing but the scariest for me: the weird picture. This Friday, after spending the evening with friends, we return around 1 a.m. to our house. Before going to bed, I go to the bathroom and discover with horror a picture on the floor. A picture of someone I don't know. I directly show it to my husband who does not recognize this person either, and I send a message to my friends with whom I spent the evening to find out if they know her (I thought that maybe the picture would have been stuck to my clothes and would have fall off when I got home). Nobody recognize that person. Once again, I asked my husband to check every rooms of the house. Again, nothing to report.  All these little incidents aren't terribly scary on their own, but it's starting to make me nervous. I am currently 6 months pregnant and I have a terrible feeling of being watched at night in my house. Every two night, I wake up panicked, either because of a nightmare or with the impression that someone has entered my house (there is few risk that someone will come into my house without me noticing, I have a very expressive husky that keep our house) and as soon as I wake up, my husband is seized with a very impressive spasm.  If you have any idea what is happening to me, please give me information, I'm pretty despair to be honest ! I also upload the picture I found in my bathroom (I already tried to search it on Google but there is no result).  https://preview.redd.it/ori3itg6prv91.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b812f7acff40219d5ee3f0bd6e3c6ea4bb9bc05 Share some stories related to Halloween I could use for a YouTube video if you’re okay with it. Thanks <3    I’ll share mine. When I was younger I’d often go treat or treating in my friends neighbourhood because her neighbourhood was more family friendly and actually hosted events. I lived in a condo so I didn’t really have much going on where I was. Anyways, we went trick or treating, we were around 8 or 9 at the time. I remember as we walked down the neighbourhood I’d randomly see people or figures in the corner of my eye and when I’d look there was no one there. Deadass it wasn’t someone who was there and walked away, I thought I was tripping at first but it happened for like 3 times that night I’d say. That was the first time it ever happened to me.  Fast forward to last year. I was 19 and it started to happen again and happens to this day. I’m don’t really believe in paranormal stuff but not totally closed minded towards it. I’ll often drive, or walk or mind my business and I’ll see a figure (male or female does not matter, sometimes even animals) and when I look again it’s nothing.  The figure in the corner of my eye looks like a normal none threatening person, so it does not alarm me. But I don’t really understand it. I’ve explained it to my friends before but obviously no one can believe it till it happens to them. This is my only weird experience, I just see figures sometimes in the corner of my eye.    To begin I must tell you about my house, it is a brick farmhouse built in the 1860s with a fairly decent plot of land with it. I did not move here at a young age, I lived in this house my whole life and I have seen many things that have made me know that there is ghosts and more in this life. Behind my house used to be a cemetery but they decided to move the bodies and rumor has it there are still a few out there that have not been uncovered. This is a rather short story but I feel it is the best one to begin my little series with. And now I shall begin.    It was a summer day I had just gotten home from school and the bus ride felt long almost too long. I had gotten off the bus and my Dad waited after work to pick us up from the bus, my brother and sister sat up front with my Dad and with no other option, I sat in the bed of the truck, I was just off in my drowsiness as we were getting closer to the house. When we were close to the area where my parents park I noticed what looked to be the end of a white sheet blow into the machine shed. Once parked I began to walk down to the barn thinking it was a sheet that had blown off the clothes line due to the wind so I was going to retrieve it for my Mom. Now that I'm older and I think about it there was not enough wind to pick a sheet up that high in the air.     As I walked down closer there was no white sheet, it was not in the barn, it was nowhere to be found. I don't know what it was, after that happened I didn't say anything for fear of my parents thinking I was just making things up but I know what I saw and if anyone has an idea as to what it could be I would love to hear. Its night i was at indian festival call diwali i was happy i use many firework soo me and my sister go at storeroom to get more fireworks when i was taking fireworks my sister say letss goo fast run run i say what happen then i heard someone coming from 1st floor no one live in 1st floor i heard walking noice when i try to check i saw i shadow getting big big and more big and looking at me and my sister then idk how whole house light got cut and shadow is coming on me and my sister then we start running in plot then we talk to mom and dad explain what happen then they check they saw I shadow standing on 1st floor looking at us then we just go out from house and call priest they said there is spirit then they clean our house with holy water after that this never happened again but still we get negative feelingPeace to all.   I used to rent a room in Hartford . My landlady and her kid also shared the house, and for a time another woman (who bounced a check and was evicted). I lived in her master bedroom. It was a small house with glass doorknobs and wooden floors, quite nice, maybe built in the thirties. You had to walk up a small hill to get into the house. This house was near Trinity College in a so-so area. It was actually a really cool neighborhood, esp. around Halloween, and the neighbors went all out for the holidays with decorations. Her husband was deceased.   The house from the beginning felt stressful. I had some strange experiences. The first one was finding the words "blood" and "f---" spray painted behind the stairs in her laundry area. I didn't know who did it or why and was too scared to ask. I was raised a superstititous Catholic so seeing that freaked me out.   The next weird experience happened when my landlady was at her boyfriend's house, who lived in another town. She would go there some weekends and leave me . Her kid would stay at a friend's house. One night I was in her living room. She had a pellet stove and it made the house very cozy in the winter time. I was sitting by it when I had the overwhelming feeling that someone was in the room, standing next to me. I left and went upstairs, quite freaked.   Things got weirder then. The room I was in felt increasingly colder at night, for no reason. And then it happened. One night I woke up around four thirty in the morning and looked at the coffee table at the end of the room. I saw it then. It was a dark face with curly hair surrounding it, kind of hovering there and staring at me. It had no features, but I knew somehow it was a man's face. I screamed and turned on the light.  Later the landlady's boyfriend told me out of the blue that my landlady's dead husband had beat her and the neighbors called him evil. And my landlady, who was very proud of her son, showed me a photo of her son as a little boy. His father was in it, and he had curly hair.   I think I somehow manifested this person's dark spirit, or else sensed an emotional imprint, because what I felt in that room that night was definitely something evil. Okay, I know it sounds crazy but please hear me out. I know people say it’s hallucinations because you miss your loved ones, but this is not that. It started when I was 4 and my Auntie Pat died from lupus. Before my mom told my brother and I the news, I saw my auntie. She came in my room while I was watching TV and sat on my bed and rubbed my hair. She had just done my braids and it wasn’t uncommon for her to come around anytime so I assumed she was visiting. She walked out of the door and I found it weird that she hadn’t spoke, but I was 4 so I left it alone. I only remember this vividly because the next morning my mom told us she had died the previous afternoon. After I asked her why she visited last night, she looked shocked and told me I was dreaming. This has happened to me with every loved one since. I’ve lost several aunties and uncles, my 2 year old cousin, my grandpa, my great-grandpa, my bestfriend, and several close friends since then. Every time, they come to me and sit quietly before leaving. The next day, or even a few hours later, I always get news that they’ve passed. The most recent was my baby’s father, who I had last saw in January. I live in an apartment now and when I saw him standing at my room door on May 22, I knew he was dead. He came at sat with me, holding my hand and kissing my forehead and when he left I broke down knowing once again someone I loved would be leaving me. I got the call a few hours later around 5 in the morning, he had passed at 12am and I saw him at 2am.My best friend passed away in 2014. I was in school at the time so I was distraught and didn’t know how I would carry on living. To this day, even being married with kids, I’m still feeling like my life is just an epilogue, like my life was paused that day I found out he died. Fair to say, I was gutted.   Anyways, I got really into my PC gaming, and I would play counter strike with my other friends that I met on college. And it’s funny because thinking back on it, I never felt alone even when it was just me when my friends were all busy.   One night, I dreamt about him. He met me at the spear pillar (a location from a Pokémon game we both loved) and he hugged me and it was as if his young self had matured while being 2-3 years on the other side, I felt his stubble against my cheek. It was very surreal.   Further on, he told me that I need to stop worrying and that he’s always with me, be it on the bus, chilling at home or at college. He said he was always there. Then he said something that quite frankly blew my mind, he mentioned how it’s nice of me to keep the spot at the end of my bed clear for him to sit down on, as it’s his favourite spot every night, he loves watching me play csgo, especially with my mates, the conversations made him laugh. He said no matter where I am he’ll find me and keep me company. It’s crazy because subconsciously I would always clear my bed and bearing in mind my room wasn’t always the tidiest! (As an adult I’ve gotten better at being tidy hahaha)   I’m so glad to have met him, and even when I’m away on deployment or even putting my kids to bed, I still feel him around and it makes me feel happy and very nostalgic!   In 2017 I got a tattoo dedicated to him too! It was my first ever tattoo!  I just miss my friend. It’s been 8 years since my mother died. She had an aggressive form of cancer which killed her in a few months. I was her primary caregiver and that meant no sleep, not much eating and getting a lot of crap from her, while doing my best to make her comfortable.   It must be mentioned, we never had a good relationship and this maybe influenced everything I’m about to write.   Over the last month before her death she had all sorts of emotions to work through, mostly fear, anger and resentment (partly towards me).  I remember she would sleep for a few minutes at a time and then wake up screaming and pulling at her clothes, saying that I had to bring her street clothes and get her out of there because “they” are coming. All the while looking horrified at the upper left corner of the room. I always tried to keep calm, to calm her down, explaining that I can’t do that, we were living in the upper level in a building without elevators and I simply couldn’t carry her 5 floors down.   The moment she passed I made a stupid mistake: I asked her, while crying, to not leave me alone. If she ever listened to me, she did it then. She stuck around for about 6 years, in my dreams, always making her presence known through noises and smells, and so on.   In our culture it is customary to have a mass, 40 days after the passing of someone. It includes setting a table for a few people, calling a priest over, sorting through the belongings of the passed one and gifting what could be worn or used. As I was preparing for that it had gotten a little late, about 22:00 and I had nowhere else to go. So I had to sleep at her apartment, on the same sofa where she died. There was no other possibility for me to sleep and so I made myself ready for bed.   In order to look for an explanation for what followed, one could say that I was really tired and stressed, and also terrified to sleep in her bed. All true, but I know what I felt and what I heard.   I left the front door open, the lights on and a radio on low volume. I wasn’t so afraid of someone walking in on me as I was of ghosts.  So I lay on the sofa, cover my head with the sheet and close my eyes. At some point I heard the front door creaking just a bit, so I opened my eyes and looked towards it. The radio turned to white noise and all I could hear were heavy footsteps on the creaking floorboards. My mother was a big woman in her healthy years and the steps I heard where that of a heavier person. Only problem is, there was no one there. The light was on so I could see clearly all the way to the front door.   Next to the sofa there was this fake leather armchair and you know how this makes a bit of noise when someone sits in it? Well, the footsteps stop in front of it, and I heard how someone put their entire weight in it and it creaked. My eyes must have been bulging out of my head and I was sure I was going to start screaming my head off any second now.  The chair kept making that noise, like someone sat in it and they pushed themselves back to find a comfortable position to sit.   Somehow I found the strength to sit myself up, all the while looking at the chair, and I said: mom, please let me sleep. I’m tired, you know how much I worked today, tomorrow we will have the mass and then it’s over with.   I kid you not, the noise stopped, the radio started playing again, I put my head on the pillow and didn’t wake up until the morning.  I don’t think I dreamed about it or imagined it, it was too clear and too sharp for it to be just a dream.    I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes, English isn’t my first language and I tried my best to not mix up tenses. when i was younger about 4 or 5 i had a rocking horse that my aunt had bought at a yard sale, the horse would always rock on its own and my parents would say i was talking to someone that wasn’t there, one day i was playing in my room alone and i seen a little blue boy he was all blue and was a little see through he pushed me off my horse and i started screaming and crying, we later got rid of the horse and put it in my grandmas attic, one time my grandma was babysitting me and we went in the attic for clay and i seen the horse i tried to ignore it but my grandma got a phone call and had to go downstairs while i was getting the clay i heard something move i turned around and the horse was moving i ran out of there and i never went back in her attic My friends are tired of this story, so I’m going to inflict it on you.  I’ve house-sit for hundreds of families, and only once was the place haunted.       I was  pet-sitting in a fancy part of town. Many of the homes aren't visible for the street, the lots are set back on acres and acres. One of the houses i sat for even had a private lake. This was a charming cabin on a winding, precarious gravel road.  It was dark, quiet, with tons of animals. This was a few days after Halloween.   I hear a racket coming from the upstairs around 11 pm. squirrels, maybe.  The next night, the racket is back at 11 pm sharp. The dog gets upset, whining and running in circles finally pissing in the corner. She’s known as the Iron Bladder, so this was unthinkable to me. We had been out only three hours previously. The racket is getting louder. Sounds like someone is walking around upstairs. Banging into things. At this point I'm scared. I call my witchy friend and she suggests I do a circle of protection. The racket dies down. We go out to the kitchen, and I see a thing in the rafters, only visible for a second. It looks like an invisible person wearing a white sheet, twirling briefly then disappearing. (Way to confirm to a stereotype, ghost 🙄). I do a protection circle, dog sits a respectable distance away while I turn in circles with a knife pointing outwards. Dog runs up to me when I finish and put the knife down, she's licking me happily.  I tell the owner that he has squirrels in the attic. He says he doesn't have an attic. I go up the stairs and see that it's an old bedroom.  My boyfriend tries to tell me that it was in my head. I try to forget this happened, but I am a jumpy mess every time I house-sit. I start declining gigs. 6 months pass. It's time for our next gig in the haunted house and I meet the owner for a walk.  (I’m pretty much convinced myself nothing happened and besides it’s really good money). He starts telling me about his son who died roughly a year ago on the property. That he believes in spirits, and he saw a giant buck pause and stare at him. “I believe that was my son." I smile and nod, unwilling to tell him I'm pretty sure I saw his son, too.  I dogsit for him again. I go for a swim in his pool, but feel something is off. I put my hands down on the side of the pool to pull myself out- and there are large handprints to either sides of my hands. I pull myself out quickly. I try to forget about what happened. But I never sat for them again. (It ended messily,  and it was my fault, but that’s beside the point). Saw this sub and thought I'd put this here, someone might find it interesting. I live in an apartment block, the doors are very heavy, if anyone in the corridor shuts a door, all the doors rattle/jolt. And I got used to it, if the people down the corridor are in and out the kitchen, my door will make a brief rattle when their kitchen door shuts. It used to make me jump but now I'm used to it and it's whatever. This wasn't what happened, I'll try and explain it, I was sitting at my desk, and my door starts rattling for no reason. There was no one in the corridor, no one in the kitchen, and no ones been outside for ages. It was completely quiet, these are fire doors, they either slam for half a second or they stay silent, there's no in between. Anyway, I'm at my desk and there's no one out there, and my door starts to jiggle. And I put it off as just living in not great accommodation. The rattling continued, it was getting louder and more violent. So I go outside to check, motion senser lights are off, no ones been in this corridor for ages. So I go back to my stuff, and it immediately starts again. And this goes on for 20 minutes, I checked about 3 times and everytime, nothing out there. I messaged the corridor and asked if anyone else had it and they all said no. It was like someone was trying to get in, like pushing on the door and rattling the handle. These fire doors will only make noise if someone else slams a door down the hall and then it'll jolt. But it'll never do this 20 minute non-stop rattle that gets progressively more aggressive. After 20 minutes, it just suddenly stopped, and it's never happened since. Anyway, I thought it was a fun story and maybe someone on this sub will like itSo, my grandpa on my mom's side died about 6-7 years ago. He's always stuck around, usually can identify him by the smell of cigarette smoke or tv channels changing suddenly.   Just last week, my grandma remarried. It was awesome, everyone is happy for her. At the wedding, I sat near the back (so that my kiddos didn't interrupt the ceremony) and was tit was there I felt my grandpa. When my grandma came out of the changing room in her wedding gown this overwhelming feeling of happiness and sadness filled me, and I could feel him standing right behind me. I bawled my eyes out. She was beautiful, I think he thought so too.   She had asked my mom months ago if it was okay for her to move on and I think that confirmed it, 100%. He just wants her to be happy.   I just wanted to share that experience, even though it wasn't spooky. Just sweet and emotional for me. Hello there everyone. Today, if you will indulge me. I would like tell you a few of the times I have had paranormal experience, and seen paranormal stuff. There aren’t any images or anything so sadly I just have my own memory to go off of. These are multiple small stories but are all 100% true. These however do take place in two different locations. I changed a name just for privacy reasons. But that is the ONLY thing that is altered in these stories. Everything is again, 100% true. This may be a longer post. So with out anymore stalling let’s get started.   This first story is the only one that I can not remember given the fact that was only 3 or 4 years old. So this is my mothers telling of the story.    This all begins about 19 years ago. The house that my parents first moved into was originally an old church, but was remodeled into being a house. Not much of the old church was left in the house minus the wood flooring in the den. Now apparently. My parents had heard choir music, the sounds of boots on hard wood floors and had even seen a shadow figure once.   But as for what happened to me. My parents where trying to move me from sleeping in there bedroom to my own. But for some reason I wouldn’t do it. My only reason being “I was scared to.” So my mom asked me. “Why, are you sleep scared to sleep in your own room. Do you need a nightlight maybe?” And apparently, I said and I quote. “Because of the tall dark man in the corner over there.” Then apparently I pointed over to a corner of my room where, surprise surprise, no one was.   A few other things happened in that house, but none to me personally. If there is interest I can make a separate post on it.   Fast forward a few years and we are at our second house. Now this is where shit starts to get crazy.  I feel like I should preface by saying there is a room in my house. We'll just call it the den. Since day one of being in this house I NEVER liked that room. I felt like I was being watched every time I was alone in there. So I did everything in my power to stay out of that room. I still do even to this day.   The first incident was when I was no older then 9 or 10. It was the last day of school for me and my little brother Mark. Me, My mom and Mark where at our house. Mark realized he left his towel at school and needed to go back and get it. My mom then turns to me and said "are you okay staying at the house for 10 mins while we go back up to the school and get it?" I said I was. (The school is less then a mile from where we where at.)   A few minutes after they left, I am sitting in the living room and I start to hear My Mom and Mark talking from my mother bathroom. Even though, I am completely home alone. I then hear them start to laugh. Then it stops. And everything was quiet. A few minutes later My Mom and Mark walked back into the house. However, 10 year old me didn't even bother to mention it for some reason.   A few years go by until the next incident.  Now before we keep going I need to explain two things to you dear reader. First thing, I need to tell you that personally I am very much so a night owl. Staying up to 3 or 4 in the morning is nothing new to me. The second thing. In my house there is a hallway. At one end is the front door, at the other end is the back door. Now, this hallway has 3 door ways/ entry ways. The den, the kitchen, and my parents room. The kitchen has a bar so you are able to see the whole living room and into my parents room, if their door is open. And then further up next to the front door is the den.   This next story takes place a few months ago, around 2-ish at night. I am standing in the kitchen washing dishes. And as I am doing so I hear two things crystal fucking clear coming from the den down the hallway. I hear an old man go "Shhhh" followed by a little girl giggling. I freeze in the middle of what I'm doing. I am the only person awake right now, I don't have a little sister, and both Mark and My dad are asleep. I am the ONLY person awake. Now, at this point I am panicking on the inside, however I am trying to keep my composure on the outside. I turn off the water in the sink and walk to my parents bedroom. I then shake my dad awake and say "Is there anyone else in this house besides Me, You, and Mark?" He simply said "No there isn't." and just falls back asleep. Annoyed, I walk out of my parents room and I am immediately looking down the hallway. Right towards the den and, there's nothing. Just like there should be. I sigh and go back to doing dishes because I still have chores that need to be done.   The next night. Again, same story. I'm doing dishes. Now, something to note. I had just stood up and my shorts slipped a bit I pulled them back up, however the front half of my shirt is now untucked, while the back half is tucked into my shorts. As I am washing dishes. I feel something grab the back of my shirt and pop it. Untucking my shorts completely. I just simple ignore it and keep doing dishes. But again, inside I am fucking terrified.   A few months go by where nothing happens. Just the same old feeling that you're being watched. Where ever you go.  Until, one night. I am heading to bed. Now this involves making sure the front and back door are both locked. So, first thing I check the front door. Its locked. So, I walk down the hallway, reach the back door and then lock it. I then turn around, and I see half a person walking into my den. The lower half. It cut off right at the waist. Now, this person was completely see through and sorta gray. Like the ghost in the [Harry Potter movies](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/d/db/Ghost_carollers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110619001435) (I hope that hyperlink works) So. I stand there for a few seconds. In pure disbelief at what I just saw. I then very quickly walk to my room and shut the door behind me.   The most recent incident was last month. This time, I was not the only person awake, however I was the only person in the house. My dad was out in the garage working. So. I am standing in the kitchen eating a sandwich. Its important to note as well, My parents door was open in this story. So, I look up for from my food for a second. And I see again, half a person standing in my parents room. But this time, its the top half. I look back down at my food. Its only after about a half of a second that my brain processed what the hell I just saw. I then quickly look back up and into my parents room, and there is nothing. No one was there.   Now, here we are in the percent day. Nothing new has happened as of late. However the feeling of being watched at night grows stronger by the day. And before anyone ask. No, I am not the only person who has experienced stuff. Both my parents and Mark have as well. Anyways. Thank you for allowing me the chance to hopefully entertain you, or even scare you it I’m lucky! I hope you enjoyed my stories. If anything happens I will be sure to write another post. So I associate this as one of my ghost stories because I’m not really sure what was talking to me, but let’s begin..  Growing up I was an avid skateboarder. I did it everyday all day and it was my transportation all over the town where I grew up. I even hung out at a skateboard shop downtown everyday after school.    Well when I was about 16 I went to the skateboard shop and it was closed so I went to a nearby school to skate instead.     Shortly after arriving a boy walked up to my friend and I. He was about 19 with dark hair and looked like a normal guy. He asked to try my skateboard and I said sure. He went on to tell us how he used to do drugs and stuff till he found god and kind of went on to tell us his life story. After a few more attempts at tricks he asked me if I’d play him skate (for those who don’t know it’s like H.O.R.S.E. But on skateboards).     I said sure why not, and he said “if I win you let me talk to you about god. If you win You can tell me off.” So I agreed knowing I wasn’t going to lose. And I didn’t.     We shook hands and he said let me just tell you one thing god wants you to know.    Well growing up I was a bit shy and I had been raised to not be rude and I didn’t want to tell him I really didn’t care. So I let him talk.     Here’s where it gets interesting.   By this point my friend had left and it was just me and this 19 year old fellow and his pocket bible. He goes to a page he has marked and starts talking about gods will. I don’t remember a single word of what he said. What I do remember is him saying “now the devil is going to try to stop me from telling you this next line”    Right then my mom calls.     She asks where I’m at and tells me it’s time to come home. I found this odd because it was only about 5 and I normally stayed out till 8 or 9. I told her I’ll head home in a minute and the phone call ends. He asks me who it was and I said my mom and I gotta go and he said ok let me just tell you this real quick and goes on to read me the verse and explain it to me.     That went on for about 10 minutes roughly.   He gets to another marked page and says “the devil doesn’t want you to know this either so he’s going to try and stop me again”  My phone rings   It’s my mom.   She’s blatantly more aggravated and tells me I need to come home and I tell her I’ll be there soon.  He asks who it was and I tell him my mom again. He just gives me a look. A look like “i told you so”   So I tell him I gotta go and he said “let me just tell you this last verse real quick.” I felt awkward and didn’t want to be rude and say no so I told him to be quick.  He tells me it and explains it and another 10 minutes pass by.    He gets to another page and he says “the devil really doesn’t want you to hear this. He’s going to try and stop me again”  My mom calls. Screaming at me to get home. So I tell him I have to go I’m in trouble. So he says “let me just tell you the verse real quick” and he does and when he finishes I finally stand my ground and leave. I rush home which takes about 15-20 minutes. The whole way home I felt out of body. Like I wasn’t myself. Well I probably got home about 630 (the time line is all guessing since it’s been 12 years)  I walk in the house and let my mom know I’m home. She’s completely calm no anger in her voice when she said “you’re home early” I said “you called me and told me to get home”     She said “I never called you”    I still don’t remember a single word from the Bible verses. Still gives me goose bumps when I tell it. Just one of my experiences with the paranormal. I'm mainly writing this because I want to share them before they get lost to time forever; I have a terrible memory. They're very few, and for all I know they were just "episodes" or something (I like to gaslight myself lol) but I'm still going to make an account of each one.   1. The Native I was very young when this happened. I think maybe 5 or 6? I was sleeping in my houses' playroom. It was nighttime. I can't remember why I was sleeping there instead of my bedroom, but I think my older brother was there too. If I had to make a guess, our church at the time would often do these vigils at churchgoers' houses so maybe our living room was filled with faithful blocking off the way to our bedrooms; us children ignored for spiritual matters. Maybe not. I really don't remember. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of the night. Or maybe I had never been asleep at all, and had just been laying there? What I do remember clearly is that from the open doorway I could see into the hall. There was a very tall dark man wearing what to me seemed like Native American clothing, just passing through. Or perhaps he was wearing Native American inspired clothing. Either way, I had never seen that man in my life, or a man remotely similar in appearance. I immediately just recognized it as a ghost, but I wasn't instantly paralyzed with fear. I just decided I would ignore it and go back to sleep, or whatever I was doing laying on the floor.   2. The Prankster I was maybe 10? 11? 12? I was alone in my mom's friend's house's kid's room lol. Everyone was somewhere else. The girl to whom the room belonged was off with the other girls her age playing. The boys were all crowded together playing video games in one room (I presume, because I'd seen them do it many times before). The adults were off somewhere else, probably chatting to pass the time. I was the only one sitting in this particular room, watching television. I remember there was a Selena Gomez song called "Love You Like A Love Song" playing on the Disney Channel. I liked the song. But suddenly I began to get this bad feeling. Where was everyone? Why was I all alone in this room? I was a loner and would usually go somewhere where I wouldn't be disturbed (or more accurately, not have to suffer my already terrible at this age social anxiety) but I usually didn't feel so... unsafe. Maybe because it was nighttime. Anyway, the TV shut off, just as I was beginning to muse this. I had weird fantasies at the time (and still do sometimes tbh, it makes life more interesting to not rule the possibility of magic or things of an occult or supernatural nature out, even if you don't necessarily consider yourself a believer lol) so I thought "Woah! Am I like Matilda or something?" lol. The honest truth is probably that I was just trying to distract my mind from the sudden chill I got down my spine. I couldn't ignore whatever presence was in the room much longer, however, when I suddenly felt something blow in my left ear from the direction of the open door to the room... or was it closed? I don't remember now. I turned around only to find nobody there. I then pieced it together, I thought. The TV was shut off from somewhere else. Someone was playing a prank on me. Probably one of the boys. They had probably just run out of the room as I was turning around. I called out my older brother's name and ran out of the room into the hallway only to find once again... nobody. Not even a sign of a disturbance. It was eerily quiet. My social anxiety prevented me from going to check on the boys' room, but I could tell that in that moment I was truly alone, everyone else preoccupied. I can't remember what I decided to do next. If I went back into the room to endure my fear alone or if I eventually got the courage to knock on that door. All I know is I never got an answer for that night. My older brother might occasionally tease and be a nuisance but he wasn't very known for playing pranks like this. Especially not on me. And my younger brother didn't have what it took to play a prank like this. It could have been one of the other kids. But I probably checked with them. Anyway, who knows.  3. The Stalker Neighbor... Or demon? The last one I have on file in my memory bank to date as of writing this.  13? 14? 15? My own room in the projects we lived in at the time. Danky room. Depressed girl. Trying to write in my journal. Or read a book. Or sing a song. I don't know what. Night. The projects could be beautiful at night. When you open your window and look out into the streetlights casting patterns onto the pavement and grassy mounds. But my window curtain wasn't open tonight. It was closed. And through it, cast in the glow of some light source, for some reason, the distinct outline of a man. I don't know HOW that made sense. I didn't know how that could make sense then either. I was very confused. Especially when I opened the curtain only to find no one there, and yet the distinct shadow still crystal clear. Unchanged, completely still. Let me be extra clear, this curtain, it's not like fabric curtains that hang from a metal pole that fold in on themselves and can be very easy to see shadows and things in them. This curtain is literally like a sheet of paper. No curves or creases. Flat and translucent. Nothing like that had ever happened before. I closed it and opened it many times. No one outside. The lots and yards were completely empty. Or was there a man there? I know this sounds crazy, but trust me that when I say I have a bad memory I REALLY mean it. Whatever there was, man or no man, that shadow, that feeling of being watched, terrified (and fascinated) me. I ran downstairs to get my mom to come see it. Come see the strange shadow in my curtain. I made her run up the stairs as fast as possible, but despite all my haste, fear and excitement, the shadow was gone as soon as I returned with mom in tow.  4? This could have easily been just seeing things so I don't know whether to count it as true. But I swear by the truth of what I felt rather than what I saw, that way it can't be said I'm not being 100% truthful. So my mom and I clean houses for a living, houses that construction companies clean out and renovate or whatever before selling them. (Yeah, sorry for the terrible ill-informed description there, barely a high school graduate for a reason lol). We arrive one day to a house and we're confused. Is this the actual house? But already, looking at the house, it feels so OCCUPIED. I got this feeling, someone definitely lives here. This isn't the right house. As we're turning in to the driveway, the windows look to me like they have black curtains hanging inside. And then, I see a white hand pulling open the black curtains as if wondering "Who is suddenly pulling into my driveway?" And then close them again, as if thinking "Must be a mistake or something." I tell my mom this. I say, "Mom, someone lives here. There's definitely someone in there." or something to that effect, 100% confident of what I saw. But then she says "Let me pray for you real quick." (In Spanish, of course.) Then we step outside and I'm confused. Did someone potentially break into the house? Maybe I should bring a weapon inside. But then when we go inside, there's no curtain. The house looks completely normal and empty inside. That feeling of being occupied isn't there anymore. My mom says "You might have seen a ghost." And then I understand why she prayed for me. I'm not a very superstitious person. It could have just been a trick of the light. It was nighttime after all (or very early morning). But, yeah. Who knows?  Sorry if this comes off as something with sort of flowery language. I just wanted to make it interesting and compelling to read. I'm not really a writer (although I wish I were talented enough to be lol). I swear on my soul that these are all true accounts written to the utmost authenticity I could manage. Thank you for reading. So I don't like to post ghost experience about when I am sleeping because people tend to think I was experiencing sleep paralysis (even though I know when I am having sleep paralysis) but here we go.  So I always get wake up calls from unexplained voice, happens all the time but this one in particular was the strangest:  I was sleeping but my dream was blank and suddenly I hears this loud 'hey' stretching around my room which made me instantly wake up (fully awake and moving), the voice bounced around my room as if faded away, I laid in the silent for a moment, thinking it might be outside noises or my house being robbed, the room had a strange atmosphere and seemed darker then usual, so I wait for a moment my heart is beating fast and out of nowhere, I feel this breathe on my neck, it heavy and harboured like it had been running, I laid stoke still for moment until I felt like some nonexistent was touching my neck, like a rub pat of a finger, I slowly pulled my blanket up to my neck, trying to stop this feeling and just like that it was gone. My room seemed to clear up and I got out of bed went to the bathroom.   I hate those encounters the most. This needs a backstory so you can look at my last post here but basically me and my friend got in contact with something very powerful, and ever since then, including later that night when im driving and it's dark, I see orange flashing orbs appear in the sky.  These orbs show up on video but my friend could not see them even though we were in same spot, but she could see it on my phone screen.  I don't know what this is or what to do I’m not sure if I’m doing this right. Okay so get ready for this. I live in a  small town with a few neighbors around me on a corner. A man across the street was killed by Street Gang, Apparently he was killed for touching or grooming his nieces or daughters but I’m not 100% sure if so it were just rumors. With that being said. Some nights I see a black figure under a street light ; most of the time I spot him with my peripherals of my eyes. I’ve never seen him directly. After a night of speaking with my neighbors. They’ve too seen the silhouette under a Bright Street light. They’ve said “ I see it once in a blue moon but never directly” in my true opinion. I believe he was killed in cold blood. He never laid a finger on the niece or daughters. If he’s still here on earth (why would he be here) id say the nieces or daughters hold on to him. Believing he did not do anything wrong. So why’d stay roaming the lonely night?Once, I was just chilling in my house one day and I heard a noise. It sounded like 3 knocks on the door. I checked and no one was there. Then I heard a loud crash from the kitchen. I went to see and the milk was all over the floor! I mopped it up and went to my living room. I noticed a picture of me had been drawn on. A lot of pranks have been happening since then, and someone is making messes. I think it might be a poltergeist. For example, I saw a carton of orange juice dump itself onto the couch. Another time, I was looking through my cupboards and I found a half eaten sandwich.On a Sunday,I went to church but when I came home, I found my bed been filled with paint. And someone has smudged food all over the walls. And whenever I leave, there is always some new mess that’s been made. My car has been egged from the inside, every time I go to the bathroom there is Saran Wrap under the lid, in the middle of the night I feel like some kid is jumping on me, and my devices have been covered in honey more than I can count. PLEASE HELP!!!! When I was around 12 years old I was at my cousin's house for a party (pretty sure it was around Christmas time). We where hanging out in their backyard and woods (part of their backyard is wooded area) and came to this tree that used to have a tree house in it. All that is left of that tree house is some steps leading to it and a few platforms (not safe to get up if you can even at all). My cousin (8 M at the time) told us this story about how the kids who had that tree house had died when it collapsed. I, personally, thought this was a bunch of B's but went with it.   We eventually headed back to the house but I decided to go back into the woods alone. As I was walking into the woods I felt a strange sense of calm wash over me, like I was safe there, safer then anywhere else. As I'm walking I'm looking around and I see a light blue and white checkered flag up in a super thin tree that I didn't notice before. As I'm looking at this and trying to figure out how it got there I started to her kids voices, laughing, talking, just having fun. I didn't think to much of it at the time as my cousins were out in the tree house (a new one they built not the old run down one).  As I'm walking closer to the old tree house the voices seem louder and I look back up at the flag. It was moving despite there not being any wind. I shock it off as I couldn't feel the wind from down here but up there there was wind and looked back down. That's when I say them. Six children with white skin, like snow white skin (there was no snow on the ground btw). They all seemed to be wearing winter gear, though dull and dirty looking. They were walking towards me but I didn't run, I wasn't afraid for some reason. I heard a branch snap and that's when I ran.  As I went back towards my cousin's house I was surprised to see that they weren't outside. I found them in the living room playing video games. When I asked them when they came in they said, "When you were walking to the woods. Why?" The kids I heard weren't them.   Still don't know to this day who those kids were.  They weren't other neighbor kids as non if them lived close to my cousins. Were they a figment of my imagination? Whatever it was it's one of the reason I believe. For context, shes my great aunt, and recently died within the last few months. I have a ghost app called Ghost Hunting, and I have two friends who are clairvoyant. They were doing the essence(?) method. I had the app open, and the first word i get was “Sandra” her legal name. She went by Sandy so I just thought it was a mistake until one of my friends said that there was an old lady presence. The next couple words I got on the app were things that I knew were Sandy. I got purple (Her favorite color), Children (She raised her brothers and sisters along with other ppls kids), and blanket (She died with a blanket that we gave her on). After this I decided to ask if we were speaking to her. My friend said yes (still blindfolded with headphones), and my other friend who was also doing the the essence method said yes at the same time. I asked how she was doing, and we got a couple different answers “I’m alright” and “I’m doing okay now.” I asked her a couple more questions, specifically about her dog Chloe. We got the responses “I found her” “She’s happy too” and “Happy” (On the app).  After this for around 20 minutes I felt a pressure on my shoulder, it was randomly comforting.
